CHAIRMAN’S
MESSAGE
The performance of all four divisions
illustrates the value of our investment
and diversification and reflects our
consistent strategy.
This produced a well-balanced result and
a full-year statutory profit of $7.1 billion,
flat on the prior year. Cash profit was
$7.4 billion, up 14% on the prior year.
Our total 2023 dividend was 175 cents
per share with the final dividend of 94 cents
partially franked at 56%. The final dividend
comprised an 81 cents dividend partially
franked at 65% and an additional one-off
unfranked dividend of 13 cents. The dividend
outcome reflects our geographic diversity
and the particularly strong results of our
businesses outside of Australia.

rapidly rising interest rates and higher
inflation. Central banks continue to grapple

the associated cost-of-living increases.

Economic outlook
The year ahead is likely to be one of economic consolidation across ANZ’s geographies. In Australia and New Zealand we expect somewhat
slower growth and only modest movements in interest rates around the peak in the cycle. Consumer spending is likely to remain weak as
the full impact of interest rate increases is felt. Demand is also likely to be supported by strong household balance sheets, resilient housing
markets, government activity, solid business investment intentions in Australia and strong migration in New Zealand. Modest increases in
unemployment and underemployment, while disruptive for the individuals involved, should be sufficient to encourage inflation back
towards target without undue delinquency stress. Both ANZ and the Reserve Bank of Australia expect to see inflation back at the top
of the band by the end of 2025.
In China, weak demand has been the main challenge. Policy has responded, activity has begun to stabilise and inflation, though there are
still deflationary pressures normalise. China’s stabilisation will support the region as it copes with the effects of its own tightening cycle and
weaker global demand.

KEY MATERIAL
RISKS
The key material risks facing the Group per the Group's RMS, and how these are managed are summarised below.
Climate change risk is managed and monitored as part of ANZ's business, strategic and capital management processes.
While climate change risk primarily manifests as financial risks, especially credit risk, it may also result in additional market,
operational or other risks.
Our understanding of climate-related risks continues to evolve and mature. On 9 November 2023 our Board Risk Committee
approved that "climate risk" will be elevated as a key material risk. This means going forward that we are further strengthening
our enterprise-wide approach to managing climate risk. We are working to embed this change and expect to disclose our
progress in our 2024 reporting. The table below discusses how climate-related risk has been managed and monitored
during our 2023 financial year.
For further information about the principal risks and uncertainties that the Group faces, see our
“Principal Risks and Uncertainties” disclosure available at anz.com/shareholder/centre.
RISK TYPE DESCRIPTION MANAGING THE RISK

who could be impacted by climate change or
by changes to laws, regulations, or other policies
adopted by governments or regulatory
authorities, including carbon pricing and
climate change adaptation or mitigation policies.
As noted above, we recently elevated climate-
related risk to be a key material risk in its own
right and will work to embed this within our RMF.

The Group uses cash profit, a non-IFRS measure, to assess the performance of its business activities. It is an industry-wide measure which
enables comparison with our peer group. We calculate cash profit by adjusting statutory profit for non-core items. In general, it represents the
financial performance of our core business activities. We use cash profit internally to set targets and incentivise our Senior Executives and
leaders through our remuneration plans. Refer to page 33 for adjustments between statutory and cash profit. The adjustments made in
arriving at cash profit are included in statutory profit which is subject to audit within the context of the external auditor’s audit of the 2023
Financial Report. Cash profit is not subject to audit by the external auditor. Our external auditor has informed the Audit Committee that
adjustments between statutory and cash profit have been determined on a consistent basis across each of the periods presented.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
There are no discontinued operations in the current period. Profit/(Loss) from discontinued operations in the comparative periods relates to
immaterial residual operational costs from divested wealth businesses and partial recovery of certain costs based on Transition Service
Agreements, which ceased in April 2022.
ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW GROUP ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE
On 3 January 2023, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZBGL) established by a scheme of arrangement, a non-operating
holding company, ANZ Group Holdings Limited (ANZGHL), as the new listed parent holding company of the ANZ Group and implemented a
restructure to separate ANZ’s banking and certain non-banking businesses into the ANZ Bank Group and ANZ Non-Bank Group (Restructure).
The ANZ Bank Group comprises the majority of the businesses and subsidiaries that were held in ANZBGL prior to the Restructure. The ANZ
Non-Bank Group comprises banking-adjacent businesses developed or acquired by the ANZ Group to focus on bringing new technology and
banking-adjacent services to the ANZ Group’s customers, and a separate service company.
This financial report has been prepared for the ANZ Group Holdings Limited consolidated group and reflects a continuation of the ANZ Group
prior to the Restructure.

Adjustments between continuing operations statutory profit and cash profit are summarised below:
Adjustment Comment for the adjustment
Economic hedges The Group enters into economic hedges to manage its interest rate and foreign exchange risk which, in
2023: $217 million loss accordance with accounting standards, result in fair value gains and losses being recognised within the Income
2022: $569 million gain Statement. We remove the fair value adjustments from cash profit since the profit or loss resulting from the hedge
transactions will reverse over time to match with the profit or loss from the economically hedged item as part of
Revenue and expense cash profit. This includes gains and losses arising from derivatives not designated in accounting hedge
hedges relationships but which are considered to be economic hedges, including hedges of foreign currency debt
2023: $90 million loss issuances and foreign exchange denominated revenue and expense streams, primarily NZD and USD (and USD
2022: $54 million gain correlated), as well as ineffectiveness from designated accounting hedges.
In the 2023 financial year, losses on economic hedges relate to funding-related swaps, principally from narrowing
USD/EUR and USD/JPY currency basis spreads. Further losses were driven by the yield curve movement impact on
net pay fixed economic hedge positions, largely during the first half of 2023. Losses on revenue and expense
hedges were mainly due to the depreciation of AUD against the NZD.

from continuing operations
Cash profit attributable to shareholders of the Company from continuing operations increased $890 million (14%) compared with the 2022
financial year.
Net interest income increased $1,707 million (11%) driven by a $65.0 billion (7%) increase in average interest earning assets and a 7 bps
increase in net interest margin. The increase in average interest earning assets was driven by lending growth across all divisions, higher liquid
assets and the impact of foreign currency translation. The increase of 7 bps was driven by favourable deposit margins, higher earnings on
capital and replicating deposits, and favourable lending mix. This was partially offset by home loan pricing competition, unfavourable deposit
mix, and Markets activities impacted by higher funding costs, primarily on commodity assets, where the related revenues are recognised as
Other operating income.
Other operating income increased $639 million (17%) primarily driven by an increase of $1,063 million in Markets other operating income
from increased customer activity and more favourable trading conditions. This was partially offset by a $232 million decrease from business
divestments/closures, $98 million of lower realised gains on economic hedges against foreign currency denominated revenue streams
offsetting net favourable foreign currency translations elsewhere in the Group, and a $43 million decrease from the loss on disposal of data
centres in Australia.
Operating expenses increased $560 million (6%) driven by inflationary impacts, incremental costs associated with strategic initiatives, higher
Suncorp Bank acquisition related costs, costs previously attributed to discontinued operations, and the initial levy under the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme of Last Resort Levy Act 2023 (CSLR Levy). This was partially offset by productivity initiatives and investment re-
prioritisation.
Credit impairment increased $477 million driven by increases in both collectively assessed and individually assessed credit impairment.

Net interest income increased $1,707 million (11%) driven by a $65.0 billion (7%) increase in average interest earning assets and a 7 bps
increase in net interest margin.
Net interest margin increased 7 bps driven by favourable deposit margin from a rising interest rate environment, higher earnings on capital
and replicating deposits, and favourable lending mix with a shift towards higher margin variable rate home loans. This was partially offset by
home loan pricing competition in the Australia Retail and New Zealand divisions, unfavourable deposit mix with a shift towards lower margin
term deposits and increased term wholesale funding relative to customer deposits, lower average yield on Markets averages earning assets
due to higher funding costs for commodity assets where the related revenues are recognised as Other operating income, and growth in
lower yielding liquid assets to replace Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF) which ceased in the first half of 2023, other increases in liquid assets
to meet regulatory compliance requirements, and higher wholesale funding rates.
Average interest earning assets increased $65.0 billion (7%) driven by lending growth across all divisions, higher liquid assets and the impact
of foreign currency translation.
Average deposits and other borrowings increased $44.4 billion (6%) driven by growth in term deposits across all divisions, higher deposits
and repurchase agreements from other banks, higher certificates of deposit and the impact of foreign currency translation. This was partially
offset by lower at-call deposits.

Net fee and commission income decreased $45 million (-2%) driven by lower revenue post Worldline business divestment in the prior year,
and lower cards revenue in the New Zealand division due to regulatory fee changes introduced in November 2022. This was partially offset by
higher cards revenue in the Australia Retail division due to recovery in spending, and higher home loan offset account and annual card fees as
waivers related to the transition of Breakfree Package concluded.
Markets other operating income increased $1,063 million driven by increases in Franchise Revenue across all business lines and geographies
from increased customer activity and more favourable trading conditions, an increase in Balance Sheet driven by favourable yield curve
movements and portfolio repricing, and an increase in Derivative Valuation Adjustments with gains from tightening credit spreads, and lower
currency and interest rate volatility.
Share of associates' profit increased $44 million (25%) driven by increase in the Group’s equity accounted share of profit from P.T Bank Pan
Indonesia and AMMB Holdings Berhad.
Other decreased $423 million (-58%) primarily driven by a gain on completion of the ANZ Worldline partnership in 2022, lower realised gains
on economic hedges against foreign currency denominated revenue streams offsetting net favourable foreign currency translations
elsewhere in the Group, and a loss on disposal of data centres in Australia. This was partially offset by the net impact from recycling of foreign
currency translation reserves from other comprehensive income to profit or loss on dissolution of a number of international entities in the
current and prior year, and a loss on sale of the financial planning and advice business in 2022.

Personnel expenses increased $466 million (9%) driven by incremental costs associated with strategic initiatives, inflationary impacts on
wages including an increase in leave provisions, costs previously attributed to discontinued operations, and the impact of unfavourable
foreign currency translation. This was partially offset by productivity initiatives and investment re-prioritisation.
Premises expenses decreased $63 million (-9%) driven by the lease exit on modification of a significant lease arrangement in the prior year,
and lower rent as the result of a reduction in the Group’s property footprint, including the exit of 55 Collins Street Melbourne in the prior year.
Technology expenses increased $79 million (5%) driven by incremental costs associated with strategic initiatives, higher software licence

from technology simplification, investment re-prioritisation, and lower amortisation.
Restructuring expenses increased $68 million (67%) driven by operational changes across all divisions.
Other expenses increased $10 million (1%) driven by higher Suncorp Bank acquisition related costs, and the initial CSLR Levy, partially offset by

The increase in collectively assessed allowance for expected credit losses was driven by $171 million for the downside risks associated with the

OUR PERFORMANCE (continued)
DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE
Australia Retail
Lending volumes increased driven by home loan growth, partially offset by lower unsecured lending. Net interest margin
decreased driven by asset margin contraction from competitive pressure, unfavourable deposit mix with a shift towards lower
margin term deposits and higher net funding costs. This was partially offset by favourable deposit margins from a rising interest rate
environment, favourable lending mix with a shift towards higher margin variable home loans and higher earnings on capital and
replicating portfolio. Other operating income increased driven by higher cards revenue reflecting an increase in consumer
spending, and higher home loan offset account and annual card fees as waivers related to the transition of Breakfree Package
concluded. This was partially offset by lower insurance-related income. Operating expenses increased driven by inflationary
impacts, incremental costs associated with strategic initiatives including ANZ Plus and higher restructuring expense. This was
partially offset by productivity initiatives and investment re-prioritisation. Credit impairment charge increased driven by higher
collectively assessed credit impairment, and higher individually assessed credit impairment due to lower write-backs and recoveries.
Australia Commercial
Lending volumes increased driven by SME and Specialist Business lending growth, partially offset by the sale of Investment Lending
business and asset finance run-off. Net interest margin increased driven by favourable deposit margins from a rising interest rate
environment and higher earnings on capital and replicating portfolio. This was partially offset by unfavourable deposit mix with a
shift towards lower margin term deposits, higher net funding costs and asset margin contraction from competitive pressure. Other
operating income decreased driven by the gain on sale relating to the ANZ Worldline partnership in the prior year and lower impact
of divested business results. This was partially offset by the loss on sale of the financial planning and advice business in the prior year,
and higher cards revenue reflecting an increase in commercial spending. Operating expenses increased driven by inflationary
pressure, incremental costs associated with strategic initiatives and higher restructuring expense, partially offset by lower costs post
business divestment and productivity initiatives. Credit impairment charge increased driven by higher collectively assessed credit
impairment, and higher individually assessed credit impairment charge.
Institutional
Lending momentum was sustained, with higher Markets balances partially offset by lower Transaction Banking volumes. Net
interest margin ex-Markets increased driven by favourable deposit margins from a rising interest rate environment and higher
earnings on capital and replicating portfolio. Other operating income increased primarily driven by higher Markets revenues from
increased customer activity and more favourable trading conditions. Operating expenses increased driven by inflationary impacts
and incremental costs associated with strategic initiatives, partially offset by productivity initiatives. Credit impairment release
increased driven by release of collectively assessed credit impairment, and release of individually assessed credit impairment due to
write-back of a single name exposure.
New Zealand
Lending volumes increased driven by home loan growth, partially offset by contraction in business lending. Net interest margin
increased driven by favourable deposit margins from a rising interest rate environment. This was partially offset by asset margin
contraction from competitive pressure and unfavourable deposit mix with a shift towards lower margin term deposits. Other
operating income decreased driven by gain on sale of government securities in 2022 and lower cards revenue due to regulatory
changes introduced in November 2022. Operating expenses increased driven by inflationary pressure and customer remediation
provision release in the prior year. Credit impairment charge increased driven by increase in collectively assessed credit impairment
and increase in individually assessed credit impairment due to lower write-backs and recoveries.
Pacific
Cash profit increased driven by higher net interest margin, loss on the planned closure of ANZ American Territories in 2022, and
higher credit impairment release due to higher write-backs.
Group Centre
2023 included the recycling of foreign currency translation reserves (FCTR gain) from other comprehensive income to profit or loss
on dissolution of a number of legal entities, loss on sale of data centres in Australia, transaction related costs, and initial CSLR Levy.
2022 included the recycling of FCTR loss from other comprehensive income to profit or loss on dissolution of a number of legal
entities, and a net charge on lease modification impacts of a significant lease arrangement.

1. Full year average, calculated as prescribed per APRA Prudential Regulatory Standard (APS 210 Liquidity) and consistent with APS 330 requirements.
Following the Restructure on 3 January 2023, the Group has operated under a non-operating holding company structure whereby:
• ANZBGL’s liquidity risk management framework remains unchanged and continues to operate its own liquidity and funding program,
governance frameworks and reporting regime reflecting its authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI) operations;
• ANZGHL (parent entity) has no material liquidity risk given the structure and nature of the balance sheet; and
• ANZ Non-Bank Group is not expected to have separate funding arrangements and will rely on ANZGHL for funding.
Furthermore, a separate liquidity policy has been established for ANZGHL and ANZ Bank Group to reflect the differing nature of liquidity risk
inherent in each business model. The Group will ensure that the parent entity and ANZ Non-Bank Group holds sufficient cash reserves to meet
operating and financing requirements.
ANZBGL Group holds a portfolio of high quality unencumbered liquid assets in order to protect the ANZBGL Group’s liquidity position in a
severely stressed environment, as well as to meet regulatory requirements. High Quality Liquid Assets comprise three categories, with the
definitions consistent with Basel 3 LCR:
• Highest-quality liquid assets: cash, highest credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities eligible for repurchase with
central banks to provide same-day liquidity.
• High-quality liquid assets: high credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities, high quality corporate debt securities
and high quality covered bonds eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity.
• Alternative liquid assets: eligible securities listed by the RBNZ and assets qualifying as collateral for the CLF.
ANZBGL Group monitors and manages the size and composition of its liquid assets portfolio on an ongoing basis in line with regulatory
requirements and the risk appetite set by the ANZBGL Board.
The LCR remained above the regulatory minimum of 100% throughout this period.

financial year) with a remaining term greater than one year as at 30 September 2023, and $1.5 billion of Additional Tier 1 Capital.

1. 2022 comparatives are based on APRA Basel 3 requirements, whereas 2023 is based on the Capital Reform requirements.
ANZ’s capital management framework includes managing capital at Level 1, Level 2 and ANZGHL Group.
ANZ’s framework includes managing to Board approved risk appetite settings and maintaining all regulatory requirements. APRA
requirements at Level 1 and Level 2 include ANZ operating at or above APRA’s expectation for Domestic Systematically Important Banks (D-
SIBs) following the implementation of APRA’s Capital Reform which was effective January 2023.
APRA’s authority for ANZGHL to be a non-operating holding company (NOHC) of an ADI includes five conditions for ANZ’s capital
management framework. All five conditions were satisfied at 30 September 2023.
ANZ Bank Group
APRA, under the authority of the Banking Act 1959, sets minimum regulatory requirements for banks including what is acceptable as
regulatory capital and provides methods of measuring the risks incurred by ANZ Bank Group.
APRA Capital Reform
APRA released new bank capital adequacy requirements applying to Australian incorporated registered banks, which are set out in APRA’s
Banking Prudential Standard documents. ANZ implemented these new requirements from 1 January 2023. The application of APRA Capital
Reform reduced RWA by $34.5 billion, equivalent to a 100 bps CET1 ratio benefit. This was partially offset by APRA’s expectations that ADIs
operate a higher capital ratio to maintain an unquestionably strong level.
The ANZ Bank Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 13.3% based on APRA Basel III standards, exceeding APRA’s minimum requirements. It
increased 105 bps driven by cash earnings, and APRA Capital Reform impacts. This was partially offset by the impact of dividends paid during
the year, underlying RWA movement, capital deductions and surplus capital transferred to ANZGHL as part of the Restructure.
At 30 September 2023, the Group’s APRA leverage ratio was 5.4% which is above the 3.5% proposed minimum for internal ratings-based
approach ADI (IRB ADI), which includes ANZ.
Dividends
Our financial performance allowed us to propose that a final dividend of 94 cents be paid on each eligible fully paid ANZ ordinary share,
partially franked at 56% for Australian taxation purposes. The final dividend is comprised of an 81 cents per share dividend partially franked at
65% and an additional one-off unfranked dividend of 13 cents per share, bringing the total dividend for the 2023 financial year to 175 cents
per share. This represents a dividend payout ratio of 71.0% of cash profit from continuing operations.
The final dividend will be paid on 22 December 2023 to owners of ordinary shares at the close of business on 17 November 2023 (record date),
and carries New Zealand imputation credits of NZD 11 cents per ordinary share.
ANZ has a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) and a Bonus Option Plan (BOP) that will operate in respect of the proposed 2023 final dividend.
For the 2023 final dividend, ANZ intends to provide shares under the DRP through an on-market purchase and BOP through the issue of new
shares.
Further details on dividends provided for or paid during the year ended 30 September 2023 are set out in Note 6 Dividends in the Financial
Report.

• Significant improvement in financial performance (see section 4.2.1) with Economic Profit2 (+293%) and Cash NPAT (+14%) up YoY, as a result of:
– Strong growth in net interest income (+11% YoY), driven by (i) disciplined volume growth across our divisions and (ii) improved margin outcomes
– in a supportive rate environment, but in the face of continuing home loan competition and customer shifts to higher rate deposit products.
– All four businesses performing strongly against their Plans.
– Continued low credit impairment charges ($245m), as a result of improved portfolio credit quality, and long-term discipline regarding customer selection.
• Costs were managed well in line with market guidance (of +5% YoY, fx adj ex large/notables), with significant productivity gains and management
focus on our investment slate, which helped to partially offset significant headwinds (e.g., inflationary pressure).
• We implemented the NOHC structure in a short time frame, BS11 was delivered (the first of any bank in NZ), Ngā Tapuwae has launched (to move
ANZ NZ core to cloud and redesign business for greater resilience, agility and lower cost), and we are operationally ready to integrate Suncorp

$500m remains.
• Strengthening risk culture (including achieving the target state of ‘Sound’ and continuing to achieve a high ‘Speak Up’ index of 84%),
reflecting sustained efforts to encourage people to speak up and challenge each other respectfully.
• No repeat adverse audits, no material Risk Appetite Statement breaches, and no material non-financial risk events.
BOARD DISCRETION Assessment: No adjustment
After several years of focus on simplifying ANZ through the sale of businesses and cost restructuring, ANZ has successfully delivered
sustainable growth in the remaining core businesses against a backdrop of increased changes in consumer behaviour, a slowdown in the
economy, as well as increasing disruption in Financial Services (via the rise of new digitally enabled business models and non-bank
competitors). The outcome also aligns strongly with the shareholder experience (see section 4.2.2).
Overall, the Board view that an ‘above target’ assessment accurately reflects overall performance in 2023, noting that STVR outcomes for the
CEO and Disclosed Executives also take into consideration performance against individual objectives.
OVERALL ASSESSMENT Assessment: Above target
The above target assessment appropriately reflects our performance with all business lines each contributing strongly together to achieve
above target financial results and strong performance against our strategic objectives - positioning ANZ well for the future.

credit cost adjustment and higher imputation credits, partially offset by higher cost of capital. 3. Peter Lee Associates 2022 Large Corporate and Institutional Relationship Banking surveys, Australia

4.2 ANZ Performance Outcomes
4.2.1 ANZ’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 2019–2023
When determining variable remuneration outcomes for the CEO, Disclosed Executives and employees a range of different financial indicators
are considered. The Group uses cash profit1 as a measure of performance for the Group’s ongoing business activities, as this provides a basis
to assess Group and Divisional performance against earlier periods and against peer institutions. The adjustments made in arriving at cash
profit are included in statutory profit which is subject to audit. Although cash profit is not audited, the external auditor has informed the
Audit Committee that the cash profit adjustments have been determined on a consistent basis across each period presented.
Statutory profit is flat compared to the prior financial year, while cash profit from continuing operations has increased almost 14%.
Underlying performance reflects stronger revenue from lending volumes across our divisions together with improved net interest margin in
a supportive rate environment which enable continued focus on investing for growth.
The table below provides ANZ’s financial performance, including cash profit, over the last five years.

of 38 Disclosed Executives in recent reporting periods (2018 to 2022) received at or above target variable remuneration. See section 5.4 for
2023 variable remuneration awarded details.
• The average STVR outcome for current Disclosed Executives is 89% of maximum opportunity. This reflects both the overall assessment of
ANZ Group performance as above target (see section 4.1), which is weighted 25% or 50%, and also individual performance (see section
6.2) which is weighted 75% or 50% depending on role. Outcomes range from 80% to 100% of maximum opportunity. The remuneration
outcomes in 2023 reflect that this is a high performing team, with all business and enablement functions each contributing significantly to
a strong performance outcome for ANZ.
• 2023 STVR awarded outcomes for both C Morgan and A Strong are based on their time as a Disclosed Executive during 2023
(i.e., ~7 months and ~11 months respectively).
• R Howell’s 2023 STVR awarded outcome reflects the period acting as the GE T&C (i.e., ~4 months).

5.3 Awarded LTVR and pre grant assessment outcome
The first award of LTVR under the new remuneration structure was made at the start of the 2023 financial year to Disclosed Executives
(Nov 2022) and the CEO (Dec 2022 post AGM), and it was awarded at full opportunity.
LTVR was not awarded in 2022, due to the transition from awarding LTVR at the beginning of the year rather than at the end.
The RR component of LTVR was subject to a pre grant assessment by the Board which determined that the award should be made at full
value (i.e., no reduction); and will be subject to a pre vest assessment by the Board of non-financial measures at the end of the four-year
performance period to determine whether the RR should vest in full.
Restricted Rights Pre Grant Assessment (see section 7.2.4)
STEP ACTION OUTCOME
Step 1 Assess Prudential Soundness Met
Step 2 Assess Risk Measures Met
Step 3 Apply Board discretion No adjustment
Pre grant assessment outcome 100%
The PR component of LTVR is subject to TSR hurdles (see section 7.2.5), which will determine the level of vesting and subsequent value of PR
at the end of the performance period.
CEO LTVR: Shareholders approved at the 2022 AGM a 2023 LTVR award of $3.375m (135% of FR), delivered in the form of 50% RR and 50% PR.
Similarly, shareholder approval will be sought at the 2023 AGM for a 2024 LTVR award of $3.375m.
Disclosed Executives LTVR: 2023 LTVR awarded at full opportunity (135% of new FR related to the structural change, and 100% for the CRO).
Note that for C Morgan, a pro-rated 2023 LTVR was granted in September 2023 (rather than November 2022) due to commencement with
ANZ partway through 2023, and R Howell was not eligible in his acting capacity. See section 7.2.3 for delivery details.

By deferring a significant portion of variable remuneration (around 80% of maximum opportunity for the CEO and Disclosed Executives
and 75% for the CRO), we seek to ensure alignment with shareholder interests, to deliver on ANZ’s strategic objectives, and to ensure a focus
on long-term value creation. Deferred variable remuneration has significant retention elements, and most importantly, can be adjusted
downwards, including to zero, allowing the Board to hold executives accountable, individually or collectively, for the longer-term impacts
of their decisions and actions.
Board discretion is applied when determining all CEO and Disclosed Executive variable remuneration outcomes including:
• STVR and LTVR outcomes for each financial year;
• LTVR vesting outcomes (pre vest assessment);
• Consideration of malus or further deferral before any scheduled release of previously deferred remuneration;
• Consideration of clawback for up to two years post payment or vesting of variable remuneration. See section 7.3.

in late November each year.
LTVR ELEMENT DETAIL
Description RR and PR provide a right to acquire one ordinary ANZ share at nil cost – as long as applicable time and performance
conditions are met. Their future value may range from zero to an indeterminate value. The value depends on
performance against the applicable performance condition and on the share price at the time of exercise.
Performance Both RR and PR have a four-year performance period commencing from 1 October and ending four years later on
period 30 September (e.g., 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2026 for the 2023 grant), noting that LTVR is awarded at the
start of the financial year (rather than the end).
A four-year performance period provides sufficient time for longer term performance to be reflected.
Deferral periods The deferral period is the sum of the four-year performance period and the applicable holding period.
The holding period commences the day after the end of the four-year performance period (e.g., 1 October 2026
in the case of the 2023 LTVR award), and finishes on the 4th, 5th or 6th anniversary of grants.
Exercise period Rights can only be exercised at the end of the relevant deferral period (4, 5 or 6 years) when the rights vest
and become exercisable.
There is a two-year exercise period which commences at the end of the relevant deferral period for RR and PR.
Expensing ANZ engages PricewaterhouseCoopers to independently determine the fair value of RR and PR, which is only used
for expensing for accounting purposes. They consider factors including: the market performance conditions, share
price volatility, life of the instrument, dividend yield, and share price at grant date.
Dividends A dividend equivalent payment (DEP) is paid in cash at the end of the relevant deferral period, but is only made
to the extent that all or part of the underlying rights meet the relevant performance condition and vest to the
individual. Dividend equivalent payments accrue over the full deferral period for RR, and only during the holding
period for PR.
Allocation The value the Board uses to determine the number of RR and PR to be allocated to the CEO and Disclosed
basis Executives is the face value of ANZGHL shares traded on the ASX in the five trading days leading up to and
including 1 October (beginning of the financial year and LTVR performance period).
LTVR is awarded around the start of the financial year in late November for Disclosed Executives and December
for the CEO (subject to shareholder approval).

7.2.4 LTVR RESTRICTED RIGHTS – CEO AND DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES1
The award of RR ensures that LTVR provides material weight to non-financial measures (as required under APRA’s Prudential Standard
CPS 511 Remuneration), as well as supporting long-term alignment with shareholders.
Having a risk-based focus reflects the intent of the Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration in ensuring remuneration arrangements
appropriately incentivise individuals to prudently manage risks. The performance conditions are designed to ensure there is focus on both
material risk events and building a strong risk culture over the longer term.

assessments
Pre vest assessment purpose: Determines whether the RR amount awarded should vest in full and is based on outcomes
over the four-year performance period.
The pre grant and pre vest assessments also take into consideration any adjustments already applied for the same
event/outcomes in either the current or prior years (i.e., adjustments to STVR and LTVR, malus and clawback),
to ensure the overall impact is fair and proportionate to the severity of the outcome. Therefore, given other
remuneration adjustments are likely to be considered first, and as the award of RR is future focused, it is anticipated
that RR will be allocated at full value in most years – unless the outcome of the following three assessment steps
determines otherwise.

Material risk The consideration of material risk outcomes is a key process that forms part of our broader Accountability and
outcomes process Consequence Framework (A&CF) (see section 8), and is a comprehensive bottom-up process designed to ensure
that all relevant events are surfaced and considered appropriately. Key steps include:
• Risk, conduct and audit events are reported in ANZ’s Compliance & Operational Risk System.
• Divisional Accountability Groups review serious risk, conduct and audit events, and provide recommendations
regarding accountability and consequences, where appropriate.
• Enterprise Accountability Group (EAG) reviews recommendations of the Divisional Accountability Groups and
make final determination (with some exceptions where local Board approval is required or for material risk takers
and other non-administrative direct reports to the CEO, where Board approval is required).
• HR Committee reviews most serious risk, conduct and audit events (as part of independent report from CRO)
and determines impacts at the Group, Division and individual level for the CEO and ExCo.

7.2.5 LTVR PERFORMANCE RIGHTS – CEO AND DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES EXCLUDING THE CRO1
LTVR ELEMENT PERFORMANCE CONDITION DETAIL
Performance The PR have TSR performance hurdles reflecting the importance of focusing on achieving longer term strategic
rights hurdles objectives and aligning executives’ and shareholders’ interests. There are two TSR performance hurdles for the
2023 grants of PR:
• 75% will be measured against a relative TSR hurdle.
• 25% will be measured against an absolute TSR hurdle.
TSR represents the change in value of a share plus the value of reinvested dividends paid. We regard it as the most
appropriate long-term measure – it focuses on the delivery of shareholder value and is a well understood and
tested mechanism to measure performance. The combination of relative and absolute TSR hurdles provides balance
to the plan by:
• Relative: rewarding executives for performance that exceeds that of comparator companies; and
• Absolute: ensuring there is a continued focus on providing positive growth – even when the market is declining.
The two hurdles measure separate aspects of performance:
• the relative TSR hurdle measures our TSR compared to that of the Select Financial Services (SFS) comparator
group, made up of core local and global competitors. This comparator group is chosen to broadly reflect the
geographies and business segments in which ANZ competes for revenue; and
• the absolute Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) TSR hurdle provides executives with a more direct line
of sight to the level of shareholder return to be achieved. It also provides a tighter correlation between the
executives’ rewards and the shareholders’ financial outcomes.
We will measure ANZ’s TSR against each hurdle at the end of the four-year performance period to determine
whether any PR becomes exercisable. We measure relative and absolute TSR hurdles independently from the other
– for example one may vest fully or partially but the other may not vest.
Relative TSR The relative TSR hurdle is an external hurdle that measures our TSR against that of the SFS comparator group over
hurdle for PR four years. The SFS comparator group is made up of: Bank of Queensland Limited; Bendigo and Adelaide Bank
Limited; Commonwealth Bank of Australia Limited; DBS Bank Limited; Macquarie Group Limited; National Australia
Bank Limited; Standard Chartered PLC; Suncorp Group Limited; and Westpac Banking Corporation.
For future LTVR awards of PR (i.e., from financial year 2024), the Board approved for DBS Bank Limited to be
removed from the comparator group (noting that this change does not apply to awards currently on foot). This
change reflects the need to better balance the weighting of international peers in our comparator group to more
appropriately reflect the change in capital allocated to Asia compared to when international comparators were
originally included in 2015 (as part of the super regional strategy at that time). When considering an appropriate
cohort of peers for benchmarking TSR performance, the Board take into consideration organisations with a similar
scope of activities, common geographical focus, broadly comparable risk compliance and regulatory profiles, and
relative stability and transparency across market cycles.
If our TSR when compared to the TSR of

LTVR ELEMENT PERFORMANCE CONDITION DETAIL
Absolute TSR The absolute CAGR TSR hurdle is an internal hurdle as to whether ANZ achieves or exceeds a threshold level of
hurdle for PR growth the Board sets at the start of the performance period. The Board reviews and approves the absolute TSR
targets each year for the PR award. When reviewing the targets, the Board references ANZ’s assessed Cost of Capital
(CoC). The CoC is determined using methodologies including the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The CoC is
regularly reviewed and updated to reflect current market conditions. Due to the prospective nature of the 2023 PR
and given the increased volatility in the 10-year bond rate, the Board determined it was appropriate to use the 2H
average CoC as the CAGR TSR target for the 2023 PR.
If the absolute CAGR of our TSR then the percentage of 2023 PR that vest
is less than 9.125% is nil
is 9.125% is 50%
reaches at least 9.125%, but is less than 13.688% is progressively increased on a pro-rata, straight-line,
basis from 50% to 100%
reaches or exceeds 13.688% is 100%
For future LTVR awards of PR (i.e., from financial year 2024), the CAGR TSR hurdle will be based on the time weighted
CoC over the four-year performance period of the PR. Therefore, the CAGR TSR target will be adjusted on a time
weighted basis unless the Board applies discretion not to adjust. The CoC will be reviewed by the Board on a
quarterly basis based on the output from the CAPM methodology (which takes into consideration the risk-free
bond rate, the market risk premium and the beta – i.e., the volatility of ANZ’s historical share price relative to the
market). Any CoC changes approved by the Board throughout the performance period are prospective only
(i.e., reflect current market factors) and will form part of the dynamic absolute TSR target calculation. Moving to
a dynamic target that reflects the changes in CoC over the performance period (rather than a static target at
the beginning of the performance period), is more responsive to changes in both interest rates and risks, and is
considered more appropriate and fairer from both an investor and executive perspective, and supports better
shareholder alignment.
Calculating When calculating performance against TSR, we:
TSR performance • reduce the impact of share price volatility – by using an averaging calculation over a 90-trading day period
for start and end values;
• ensure an independent measurement – by engaging the services of an external organisation, to calculate ANZ’s
performance against both the absolute and relative TSR hurdles; and
• test the performance against the relevant hurdle once only at the end of the four-year performance period –
the rights lapse if the performance hurdle is not met – there is no retesting.
7.3 Downward adjustment – Board discretion
The Board can exercise its discretion to apply a number of downward adjustment options as part of consequence management (in
accordance with applicable law and any terms and conditions provided). The Board may choose to exercise the following options or a
combination of these at any time, but will always consider their use if any of the circumstances specified by Prudential Standard CPS 511
Remuneration occur. The downward adjustment options specified in #1 to #3 below are applicable to all employees, while clawback (#4) in
2023 is currently limited to select employees (primarily the CEO, Disclosed Executives and some senior employees in jurisdictions where
clawback regulations apply):
1. In year adjustment, the most common type of downward adjustment, which reduces the amount of variable remuneration an employee
may have otherwise been awarded for that year.
2. Further deferral/freezing delays the decision to pay/allocate variable remuneration, or further defers the vesting of deferred remuneration
or freezes vested/unexercised shares and rights. This would typically only be considered where an investigation is pending/underway.
3. Malus is an adjustment to reduce the value of all or part of deferred remuneration before it has vested. Malus is used in cases of more
serious performance or behaviour issues. Any and all variable remuneration we award or grant to an employee is subject to ANZ’s on-going
and absolute discretion to apply malus and adjust variable remuneration downward (including to zero) at any time before the relevant
variable remuneration vests.
4. Clawback is the recovery of variable remuneration that has already vested or been paid (up to two years from vesting/payment or a longer
period as determined by Board discretion, policy or applicable law). This would typically only be considered if the other types of downward
adjustment/other consequences are considered inadequate given the severity of the situation.
Before any scheduled vesting of deferred remuneration, the Board (for the CEO, Disclosed Executives and other specified roles) and/or the
Enterprise Accountability Group (EAG) (for other employees) considers whether any further deferral, malus, or clawback should be applied.

9 NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR (NED) REMUNERATION
9.1 Remuneration structure
The HR Committee reviewed NED fees and determined not to increase fees for 2023.
For 2024, the HR Committee has reviewed and approved a 2% increase to the NED member fee (from $240,000 to $245,000) which has
remained unchanged since 2016. The Board Chairman fee remains unchanged. Following review, the HR Committee also approved the
alignment of the fee structure across all Committees increasing each Committee chair fee to $68,000, and each Committee member fee
to $34,000. This fee review considered increased complexity in the regulatory environment, uplifts for ANZ’s broader employee population,
and the external market.
The fee structure is applicable to NEDs of ANZGHL and ANZBGL. Fees prior to the implementation of the Non-Operating Holding Company
(NOHC) structure related to membership of the ANZBGL Board, and post implementation are viewed as a single fee covering both Boards
(i.e., membership of ANZGHL and ANZBGL Boards/Committees). Currently the fee structure applies irrespective of whether NEDs serve on
one or more Boards.
NEDs receive a fee for being a Director of the Board, and additional fees for either chairing, or being a member of a Board Committee.
The Chairman of the Board does not receive additional fees for serving on a Board Committee.
In setting Board and Committee fees, the following are considered: general industry practice, ASX Corporate Governance Principles and
Recommendations, the responsibilities and risks attached to the NED role, the time commitment expected of NEDs on Group and Company
matters, and fees paid to NEDs of comparable companies.
ANZ compares NED fees to a comparator group of Australian listed companies with a similar market capitalisation, with particular focus on
the major financial services institutions. This is considered an appropriate group, given similarity in size and complexity, nature of work and
time commitment by NEDs.
To maintain NED independence and impartiality:
• NED fees are not linked to the performance of the Group; and
• NEDs are not eligible to participate in any of the Group’s variable remuneration arrangements.
The current aggregate fee pool for NEDs of $4m was approved by shareholders at the 2012 AGM. The annual total of NEDs’ fees, including
superannuation contributions, is within this agreed limit.
This table shows the NED fee policy structure for 2023.

Ethics, Environment, Social & Governance Committee $55,000 $27,500
1. Including superannuation. 2. The Chairman of the Board does not receive additional fees for serving on a Board Committee. The Chairman of the Board and NEDs do not receive a fee for
serving on the Nomination and Board Operations Committee.
NED shareholding guidelines
We expect our NEDs to hold ANZ shares. NEDs are required:
• to accumulate shares – over a five-year period from their appointment to the value of:
– 100% of the NED member fee for Directors;
– 100% of the Chairman fee for the Chairman; and
• to maintain this shareholding while they are a Director of ANZ.
Based on the ANZ share price as at 30 September 2023, all NEDs meet or, if less than five years' tenure, are on track to meet
the holding guideline.

10.2.3 CEO AND DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES’ CONTRACT TERMS AND EQUITY TREATMENT
The details of the contract terms and the equity treatment on termination (in accordance with the Conditions of Grant) relating to the CEO
and Disclosed Executives are below. Although they are similar, they vary in some cases to suit different circumstances.
Type of contract Permanent ongoing employment contract.
Notice on resignation • 12 months by CEO;
• 6 months by Disclosed Executives.1
Notice on termination • 12 months by ANZ for CEO and Disclosed Executives.3
by ANZ2
However, ANZ may immediately terminate an individual’s employment at any time in the case of serious
misconduct. In that case, the individual will be entitled only to payment of FR up to the date of their
termination and their statutory entitlements.
How unvested equity is Executives who resign or are terminated will forfeit all their unvested deferred equity – unless the Board
treated on leaving ANZ determines otherwise.
If an executive is terminated due to redundancy or they are classified as a ‘good leaver’, unless the Board
determines otherwise, then:
• their STVR (deferred shares/share rights) remain on foot and are released at the original vesting date;
• their LTVR (RR/PR) (for grants awarded from 31 December 2020) remain on foot and are released at the
original vesting date (to the extent that the performance hurdles are met); and
• their PR4 (for grants awarded pre 31 December 2020) are prorated for service to the full notice termination
date and released at the original vesting date (to the extent that the performance hurdles are met).
On an executive’s death or total and permanent disablement, their deferred equity vests.
Unvested equity remains subject to malus post termination.
Change of control If a change of control or other similar event occurs, then we will test the performance conditions applying to
(applies to the CEO only) the CEO’s LTVR (RR/PR). They will vest to the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied.
1. 3 months by the former Acting GE T&C. 2. For M Carnegie, K Corbally, F Faruqui, G Florian, R Howell, C Morgan, A Strong, M Whelan and K van der Merwe, their contracts state that in particular
circumstances they may be eligible for a retrenchment benefit in accordance with the relevant ANZ policy, as varied from time to time. For A Watson, notice on retrenchment is 6 weeks and
compensation on retrenchment is calculated on a scale up to a maximum of 79 weeks after 25 years’ service. 3. 6 months by ANZ for the Acting GE T&C. 4. Or deferred share rights granted to the

1. Cash salary includes any adjustments required to reflect the use of ANZ's Lifestyle Leave Policy for the period in the KMP role. 2. Non monetary benefits generally consist of company-funded
benefits (and the associated Fringe Benefits Tax) such as car parking, taxation services and costs met by the Company in relation to relocation/accommodation. 3. The total cash incentive relates
to the cash component of STVR only. The relevant amortisation of the STVR deferred components is included in share-based payments and has been amortised over the vesting period. The total
STVR was approved by the ANZBGL and ANZGHL Boards on 17 October 2023, and in addition for A Watson by the ANZ NZ Board on 17 October 2023. 100% of the cash component of the STVR
awarded for the 2022 and 2023 years vested to the executive in the applicable financial year. 4. Other cash and other equity allocations (C Morgan) relate to the employment arrangements of
deferred variable remuneration forfeited and bonus opportunity forgone as a result of joining ANZ. 5. For Australian based executives, the 2022 and 2023 superannuation contributions reflect
the Superannuation Guarantee Contribution based on the Maximum Contribution Base. F Faruqui's 2022 amount reflects a part year superannuation contribution. A Watson participates in
KiwiSaver where ANZ provides an employer superannuation contribution matching member contributions up to 4% of total gross pay. KiwiSaver employer superannuation contributions are also
contributed on top of cash STVR at the time of payment. 6. For Australian based executives, long service leave accrued takes into consideration the impact of changes to the Superannuation
Guarantee percentage. Year-on-year fluctuations in long service leave accrued relate to the impact of historical fixed remuneration increases on the accrual as calculated at the end of each

financial year. 7. As required by AASB 2 Share-based payments, the amortisation value includes a proportion of the fair value (taking into account market-related vesting conditions) of all equity
that had not yet fully vested as at the commencement of the financial year. The fair value is determined at grant date and is allocated on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period.
The amount included as remuneration neither relates to, nor indicates, the benefit (if any) that the executive may ultimately realise if the equity becomes exercisable. No terms of share-based
payments have been altered or modified during the financial year. There were no cash settled share-based payments or any other form of share-based payment compensation during the financial
year for the CEO or Disclosed Executives. 8. Other equity allocations (A Watson) relate to shares received in relation to the historical Employee Share Offer which provided a grant of ANZ shares

expensing treatment on resignation for unvested deferred remuneration (including reversals for forfeiture on resignation). Termination benefits reflect payment for accrued annual leave in
accordance with her contract, payable on resignation.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
NFOINTAESN TCOIA TLH ES TCAOTNESMOELINDTASTED FINANCI AL STATEMENTS
1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ORGANISATIONAL RESTRUCTURE
On 3 January 2023, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZBGL) established by a scheme of arrangement, a non-operating holding
company, ANZ Group Holdings Limited (ANZGHL), as the new listed parent holding company of the ANZ Group and implemented a restructure to
separate ANZ’s banking and certain non-banking businesses into the ANZ Bank Group and ANZ Non-Bank Group (the Restructure). The ANZ Bank
Group comprises the majority of the businesses and subsidiaries that were held in ANZBGL prior to the Restructure. The ANZ Non-Bank Group
comprises banking-adjacent businesses developed or acquired by the ANZ Group to focus on bringing new technology and banking-adjacent
services to the ANZ Group’s customers, and a separate service company.
Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements reflect a continuation of the existing ANZ Group and have been prepared on the basis of
accounting policies and using methods of computation consistent with those applied in the 2022 ANZ Annual Report.
GENERAL INFORMATION
These are the consolidated financial statements for ANZGHL (the Company) and its controlled entities (together, the Group or Consolidated Entity) for
the year ended 30 September 2023. The Company is a publicly listed company incorporated and domiciled in Australia. The address of the Company’s
registered office and its principal place of business is ANZ Centre, 833 Collins Street, Docklands, Victoria, Australia 3008. The Group provides banking
and financial services to individuals and business customers and operates in and across 29 markets.
On 10 November 2023, the Directors resolved to authorise the issue of these financial statements. Information in the financial statements is included
only to the extent we consider it material and relevant to the understanding of the financial statements. A disclosure is considered material and
relevant if, for example:
• the amount is significant in size (quantitative factor);
• the information is significant by nature (qualitative factor);
• the user cannot understand the Group’s results without the specific disclosure (qualitative factor);
• the information is critical to a user’s understanding of the impact of significant changes in the Group’s business during the period - for example,
business acquisitions or disposals (qualitative factor);
• the information relates to an aspect of the Group’s operations that is important to its future performance (qualitative factor); and
• the information is required under legislative requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) or by the Group’s principal
regulators, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).
This section of the financial statements:
• outlines the basis upon which the Group’s financial statements have been prepared; and
• discusses any new accounting standards or regulations that directly impact the financial statements.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
This financial report is a general purpose (Tier 1) financial report prepared by a ‘for profit’ entity, in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards
(AASs) and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), the Corporations Act 2001, and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
We present the financial statements of the Group in Australian dollars, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. We have
rounded values to the nearest million dollars ($m), unless otherwise stated, as allowed under the ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors
Report) Instrument 2016/191. We measure the financial statements of each entity in the Group using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which that entity operates (the functional currency).
BASIS OF MEASUREMENT AND PRESENTATION
We have prepared the financial information in accordance with the historical cost basis - except the following assets and liabilities which we have
stated at their fair value:
• derivative financial instruments and in the case of fair value hedging, a fair value adjustment made to the underlying hedged item;
• financial instruments held for trading;
• financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL);
• financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI); and
• assets and liabilities classified as held for sale (except those required to be at carrying value).
In accordance with AASB 119 Employee Benefits we have measured defined benefit obligations using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
There were no discontinued operations in the current period. For the purpose of comparative information, discontinued operations in the prior period
are separately presented from the results of the continuing operations as a single line item ‘Profit/(Loss) after tax from discontinued operations’ in the
Income Statement.

1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries. An entity, including a
structured entity, is considered a subsidiary of the Group when we determine that the Company has control over the entity. Control exists when the
Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its
power over the entity. We assess power by examining existing rights that give the Company the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the
entity. We have eliminated, on consolidation, the effect of all transactions between entities in the Group.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. At the
reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the relevant spot rate.
Any foreign currency translation gains or losses that arise are included in profit or loss in the period they arise.
We measure translation differences on non-monetary items classified as FVTPL and report them as part of the fair value gain or loss on these items. For
non-monetary items classified as investment securities measured at FVOCI, translation differences are included in other comprehensive income.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS THAT HAVE A FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY THAT IS NOT AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS
The financial statements of our foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars for consolidation into the Group financial statements using the
following method:
Foreign currency item Exchange rate used
Assets and liabilities The reporting date rate
Equity The initial investment date rate
Income and expenses The average rate for the period – but for a significant transaction if we believe the average rate is not
reasonable, then we use the rate at the date of the transaction
Exchange differences arising from the translation of financial statements of foreign operations are recognised in the foreign currency translation
reserve in equity. When we dispose of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences are transferred to profit or loss.
FIDUCIARY ACTIVITIES
The Group provides fiduciary services to third parties including custody, nominee and trustee services. This involves the Group holding assets on
behalf of third parties and making decisions regarding the purchase and sale of financial instruments. If ANZ is not the beneficial owner or does not
control the assets, then we do not recognise these transactions in these financial statements, except when required by accounting standards or
another legislative requirement.
KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements and applied estimates and
assumptions about past and future events. Further information on the key judgements and estimates that we consider material to the
financial statements are contained within each relevant note to the financial statements.
The global economy is facing challenges associated with high inflation and interest rates, labour market constraints, continuing
geopolitical tensions, and impacts from climate change which contribute to an elevated level of estimation uncertainty involved in the
preparation of these financial statements.
The Group has made various accounting estimates in this Financial Report based on forecasts of economic conditions which reflect
expectations and assumptions at 30 September 2023 about future events considered reasonable in the circumstances. Thus there is a
considerable degree of judgement involved in preparing these estimates. Actual economic conditions are likely to be different from those
forecast since anticipated events frequently do not occur as expected, and the effect of these differences may significantly impact
accounting estimates included in these financial statements. The significant accounting estimates impacted by these forecasts and
associated uncertainties are predominantly related to expected credit losses and recoverable amounts of non-financial assets.
The impact of these uncertainties on each of these accounting estimates is discussed in the relevant notes in this Financial Report. Readers
should consider these disclosures in light of the inherent uncertainties described above.

Overview
environment overview report report report information NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM
Interbank offered rates (IBORs) reform is the global transition away from IBORs and their replacement by risk-free rates (RFRs). IBOR reforms have had a
wide-ranging impact for the Group and our customers given the fundamental differences between IBORs and RFRs. Accordingly, the Group
established an enterprise-wide Benchmark Transition Program to manage the operational, market, legal, conduct and financial reporting risks
associated with IBOR transition.
As at 30 September 2023 the Group’s Program is largely complete, and included the implementation of the required processes, technology and
product capabilities that ensured the transitions were successfully undertaken. In line with regulatory announcements made in early 2021, IBOR rates
including Pound Sterling (GBP), Euro (EUR), Swiss Franc (CHF) and Japanese Yen (JPY), and the 1-week and 2-month US Dollar (USD) London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate settings ceased on 31 December 2021 and were replaced by alternative RFRs. The Group’s exposure to IBOR reform was
primarily concentrated in other USD LIBOR settings which ceased on 30 June 2023. No material changes were made to the Group’s risk management
strategy because of IBOR reform and the use of IBOR rates in new products was phased out in accordance with industry and supervisory guidance. The
transition activities had an immaterial impact to the Group’s profit and loss.
To support any legacy contracts referencing these benchmarks across the industry, the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month USD settings will continue to
be published using an alternative ‘synthetic’ methodology. The Group continues to manage a small number of loan and derivative contracts whose
transition is being managed with customers, and a small number of debt issuances with investors. These remaining contracts will either mature or
transition ahead of the synthetic USD LIBOR cessation date of 30 September 2024. The Group has an immaterial exposure to other announced
benchmark cessation events expected to occur between 2024 and 2026.
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED IN THE PERIOD
Accounting policies have been consistently applied, unless otherwise noted.
AASB 2023-2 AMENDMENTS TO AUSTRALIAN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS – INTERNATIONAL TAX REFORM – PILLAR TWO MODEL RULES
In May 2023, the Federal Government announced it will implement key aspects of Pillar Two of the OECD/G20 Two-Pillar Solution to address the tax
challenges arising from digitalisation of the economy. This measure is not yet law. Other jurisdictions in which ANZ operates are also considering
implementation of the regime. The ANZ Group is expected to be within the scope of associated legislation. In anticipation of legislation being
enacted, the AASB issued AASB 2023-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules in June
2023. The Group has applied the mandatory exemption included in para. 4A of this standard and will apply the whole amending standard from 1
October 2023. This amending standard stipulates a mandatory temporary exemption from recognising deferred tax assets and liabilities related to
Pillar Two income taxes. The Group is monitoring progress of associated legislation and has not yet determined the expected impact on its financial
statements.
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT EARLY ADOPTED
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been published but are not mandatory for the financial statements
for the year ended 30 September 2023 and have not been applied by the Group in preparing these financial statements. Further details of these are
set out below.
GENERAL HEDGE ACCOUNTING
AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) introduced new hedge accounting requirements which more closely align accounting with risk management
activities undertaken when hedging both financial and non-financial risks. AASB 9 provided the Group with an accounting policy choice to continue
to apply the AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (AASB 139) hedge accounting requirements until the International
Accounting Standards Board’s ongoing project on Dynamic Risk Management (macro hedge accounting) is completed. The Group continues to apply
the hedge accounting requirements of AASB 139.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT EARLY ADOPTED (continued)
AASB 17 INSURANCE CONTRACTS (AASB 17)
The final version of AASB 17 was issued in July 2017 and is not effective for the Group until 1 October 2023. It will replace AASB 4 Insurance Contracts,
AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts. AASB 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts.
The measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements under AASB 17 are significantly different from current accounting standards. Although
the overall profit recognised in respect of insurance contracts will not change, it is expected that the timing of profit recognition will change.
AASB 17 will not have a material impact on the Group.
DEFERRED TAX RELATED TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM A SINGLE TRANSACTION
AASB 2021-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction
amends AASB 112 Income Taxes. It clarifies that entities are required to recognise deferred tax on transactions for which there is both an asset and a
liability and that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences which may apply to leases and decommissioning or restoration
obligations. This amendment is effective for the Group from 1 October 2023 and will not have a material impact on the Group.
LEASE LIABILITY IN A SALE AND LEASEBACK
AASB 2022-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback amends AASB 16 Leases and specifies the
accounting for variable lease payments by seller-lessees in sale and leaseback transactions. The amendment is effective from 1 October 2024 and will
not have a material impact on the Group.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
NET INTEREST INCOME
Interest Income and Expense
We recognise interest income and expense in net interest income for all financial instruments, including those classified as held for trading,
assets measured at FVOCI, and assets and liabilities designated at FVTPL. We use the effective interest rate method to calculate the
amortised cost of assets held at amortised cost and to recognise interest income on financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI.
The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the stream of estimated future cash receipts or payments over the expected life of the
financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. For assets subject to
prepayment, we determine their expected life on the basis of historical behaviour of the particular asset portfolio taking into account
contractual obligations and prepayment experience.
We recognise fees and costs, which form an integral part of the financial instrument (for example loan origination fees and costs), using the
effective interest rate method. These are presented as part of interest income or expense depending on whether the underlying financial
instrument is a financial asset or financial liability.
Major Bank Levy
The Major Bank Levy Act 2017 (levy or major bank levy) applies a rate of 0.06% to certain liabilities of ANZBGL. The levy represents a finance
cost and it is presented as interest expense in the Income Statement.

OTHER OPERATING INCOME
Fee and Commission Revenue
We recognise fee and commission revenue arising from contracts with customers (a) over time when the performance obligation is
satisfied across more than one reporting period, or (b) at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied immediately or is
satisfied within one reporting period.
• lending fees exclude fees treated as part of the effective yield calculation of interest income. Lending fees include certain guarantee and
commitment fees where the loan or guarantee is not likely to be drawn upon, and other fees charged for providing customers a distinct
good or service that are recognised separately from the underlying lending product.
• non-lending fees include fees associated with deposit and credit card accounts, interchange fees and fees charged for specific customer
transactions such as international transaction fees. Where the Group provides multiple goods or services to a customer under the same
contract, the Group allocates the transaction price of the contract to distinct performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone
selling price of each performance obligation. Revenue is recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied.
• commissions represent fees from third parties where we act as an agent by arranging a third party (such as an insurance provider) to
provide goods and services to a customer. In such cases, we are not primarily responsible for providing the underlying good or service
to the customer. If the Group collects funds on behalf of a third party when acting as an agent, we only recognise the net commission
retained as revenue. When the commission is variable based on factors outside our control (such as a trail commission), revenue is only
recognised if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the variable amount will not be required in future periods.
• funds management income represents fees earned from customers for providing asset management services. Revenue is recognised
over the period in which the asset management services are delivered. Performance fees associated with funds management activities
are only recognised when it becomes highly probable the performa nce hurdle will be achieved.
Net Foreign Exchange Earnings and Other Financial Instruments Income
We recognise the following as net foreign exchange earnings and other financial instruments income:
• exchange rate differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and translation differences on monetary items translated at rates
different to those at which they were initially recognised or included in a previous financial report;
• fair value movements (excluding realised and accrued interest) on derivatives not designated as accounting hedges that we use to
manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk on funding instruments;
• the ineffective portions of fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges;
• immediately upon sale or repayment of a hedged item, the unamortised fair value adjustments to items designated as fair value hedges
and amounts accumulated in equity related to designated cash flow hedges;
• fair value movements on financial assets and financial liabilities designated at FVTPL or held for trading;
• amounts released from the FVOCI reserve when a debt instrument classified as FVOCI is sold; and
• the gain or loss on derecognition of financial assets or liabilities measured at amortised cost.
Gain or Loss on Disposal of Non-Financial Assets
The gain or loss on the disposal of assets is the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the proceeds of disposal net of costs.
This is recognised in Other income in the year in which control of the asset transfers to the buyer.
When a non-financial asset or group of assets is classified as held for sale, it is measured at the lower of its carrying amount immediately
prior to reclassification and fair value less costs to sell, with any remeasurement recognised in Other operating income to align with the
classification of gain or loss on sale that would have applied if the sale had completed during the year.

• premiums received (net of reinsurance premiums paid) based on an assessment of the likely pattern in which risk will emerge over the
term of the policies written. This assessment is undertaken periodically and updated in accordance with the latest pattern of risk
emergence; and
• claims incurred net of reinsurance, on an accruals basis once the liability to the policy owner has been established under the terms of
the contract and through actuarial assumptions of future claims.
SHARE OF ASSOCIATES’ PROFIT/(LOSS)
The equity method is applied to accounting for associates. Under the equity method, our share of the after tax results of associates is
included in the Income Statement and the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

4. OPERATING EXPENSES (continued)
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
OPERATING EXPENSES
Operating expenses are recognised as services are provided to the Group, over the period in which an asset is consumed, or once a liability
is created.
SALARIES AND RELATED COSTS - ANNUAL LEAVE, LONG SERVICE LEAVE AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Wages and salaries, annual leave and other employee entitlements expected to be paid or settled within twelve months of employees
rendering service are measured at their nominal amounts using remuneration rates that the Group expects to pay when the liabilities are
settled.
We accrue employee entitlements relating to long service leave using an actuarial calculation. It includes assumptions regarding staff
departures, leave utilisation and future salary increases. The result is then discounted using market yields at the reporting date. The market
yields are determined from a blended rate of high quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity that closely match the estimated future
cash outflows.
If we expect to pay short term cash bonuses, then a liability is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to
pay this amount (as a result of past service provided by the employee) and the obligation can be reliably measured.
Personnel expenses also include share-based payments which may be cash or equity settled. We calculate the fair value of equity settled
remuneration at grant date, which is then amortised over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in share capital or the share
option reserve as applicable. When we estimate the fair value, we take into account market vesting conditions, such as share price
performance conditions. We take non-market vesting conditions, such as service conditions, into account by adjusting the number of
equity instruments included in the expense.
After the grant of an equity-based award, the amount we recognise as an expense is reversed when non-market vesting conditions are not
met, for example an employee fails to satisfy the minimum service period specified in the award due to resignation, termination or notice
of dismissal for serious misconduct. However, we do not reverse the expense if the award does not vest due to the failure to meet a
market-based performance condition.
Further information on share-based payment schemes operated by the Group during the current and prior year is included in Note 32
Employee Share and Option Plans.

TAX CONSOLIDATION
The Company and all its wholly owned Australian resident entities are part of a tax-consolidated group under Australian taxation law. Following the
Restructure on 3 January 2023, the Company is the head entity in the tax-consolidated group. We recognise each of the following in the separate
financial statements of members of the tax consolidated group on a ‘group allocation’ basis: tax expense/income, and deferred tax liabilities/assets
that arise from temporary differences for members of the tax-consolidated group. The Company (as head entity in the tax-consolidated group)
recognises current tax liabilities and assets of the tax-consolidated group.
Under a tax funding arrangement between the entities in the tax-consolidated group, amounts are recognised as payable to or receivable by the
Company and each member of the tax-consolidated group in relation to the tax contribution amounts paid or payable between the Company and
the other members of the tax-consolidated group.
Members of the tax-consolidated group have also entered into a tax sharing agreement that provides for the allocation of income tax liabilities
between the entities were the head entity to default on its income tax payment obligations.
UNRECOGNISED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Unrecognised deferred tax assets related to unused realised tax losses (on revenue account) total $1 million (2022: $1 million) for the Group.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets related to unused capital losses amount to $370 million (2022: nil) for the Group.
Unrecognised deferred tax liabilities related to additional potential foreign tax costs (assuming all retained earnings in offshore branches and
subsidiaries are repatriated) total $286 million (2022: $250 million) for the Group.
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
INCOME TAX EXPENSE
Income tax expense comprises both current and deferred taxes and is based on the accounting profit adjusted for differences in the
accounting and tax treatments of income and expenses (that is, taxable income). We recognise tax expense in profit or loss except when
the tax relates to items recognised directly in equity and other comprehensive income, in which case we recognise the tax directly in
equity or other comprehensive income respectively.
CURRENT TAX EXPENSE
Current tax is the tax we expect to pay on taxable income for the year, based on tax rates (and tax laws) which are enacted at the reporting
date. We recognise current tax as a liability (or asset) to the extent that it is unpaid (or refundable).
DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
We account for deferred tax using the balance sheet method. Deferred tax arises because the accounting income is not always the same as
the taxable income. This creates temporary differences, which usually reverse over time. Until they reverse, we recognise a deferred tax
asset, or liability, on the balance sheet. We measure deferred taxes at the tax rates that we expect will apply to the period(s) when the asset
is realised, or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.
We offset current and deferred tax assets and liabilities only to the extent that:
• they relate to income taxes imposed by the same taxation authority;
• there is a legal right and intention to settle on a net basis; and
• it is allowed under the tax law of the relevant jurisdiction.
KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
Judgement is required in determining provisions held in respect of uncertain tax positions. The Group estimates its tax liabilities based on
its understanding of the relevant law in each of the countries in which it operates and seeks independent advice where appropriate.

3. Includes on-market share purchases for the DRP of $326 million (2022: $204 million).
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN AND BONUS OPTION PLAN
Eligible shareholders can elect to reinvest their dividend entitlement into ANZ ordinary shares under the Company’s Dividend Reinvestment Plan
(DRP). Eligible shareholders can elect to forgo their dividend entitlement and instead receive ANZ ordinary shares under the Company’s Bonus Option
Plan (BOP). For the 2023 final dividend, ANZ intends that the DRP participation will be satisfied by the allocation of shares purchased on-market and
the BOP participation will be satisfied by an issue of new ANZ ordinary shares. There will be no discount applied to the DRP and BOP price.
Refer to Note 24 Shareholders’ Equity for details of shares the Company purchased or issued in respect of the DRP and BOP.

New Zealand imputation credits available (which can be attached to our Australian

The above amounts represent the balances of the franking accounts as at the end of the financial year, adjusted for:
• franking credits/debits that will arise from the settlement of the 2023 income tax position; and
• franking credits/debits from the receipt/payment of dividends that have been recognised as tax receivables/payables as at the end of the financial
year.
Instalment tax payments on account of the 2023 and 2024 financial year, which will be made after 30 September 2023, will generate sufficient franking
credits to enable the 2023 final dividend to be partially franked. The extent to which future dividends will be franked will depend on a number of
factors, including the level of profits generated by the Group that will be subject to tax in Australia.
RESTRICTIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS
The Company’s ability to pay dividends on ANZ ordinary shares is largely dependent on the receipt of broadly similar amounts in dividend from the
ANZ Bank Group, which in turn requires APRA’s prior written approval if:
• the aggregate dividends exceed the ANZ Bank Group’s after tax earnings (in calculating those after tax earnings, we take into account any
payments we made on senior capital instruments) in the financial year to which they relate; or
• the ANZ Bank Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio falls within capital range buffers specified by APRA.
If the ANZ Bank Group fails to pay a dividend or distribution on its ANZ Capital Notes or ANZ Capital Securities on the scheduled payment date, it may
(subject to a number of exceptions) be restricted from resolving to pay or paying any dividend on its ordinary shares issued to the Company.

7. EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares (WANOS) outstanding during the period (after eliminating ANZ shares held within the Group known as treasury shares). Diluted EPS is
calculated by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the basic
EPS calculation for the effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares.

8. SEGMENT REPORTING
DESCRIPTION OF SEGMENTS
The Group’s six operating segments are presented on a basis that is consistent with the information provided internally to the Chief Executive Officer
(CEO), who is the chief operating decision maker. This reflects the way the Group’s businesses are managed, rather than the legal structure of the
Group.
We measure the performance of operating segments on a cash profit basis. To calculate cash profit, we exclude items from profit after tax attributable
to shareholders. For 2023 and 2022, the adjustments relate to impacts of economic hedges and revenue and expense hedges which represent timing
differences that will reverse through earnings in the future. Transactions between divisions across segments within the Group are conducted on an
arm’s-length basis and disclosed as part of the income and expenses of these segments.
The presentation of divisional results has been impacted by the following structural changes during the period. Prior period comparatives have been
restated:
• Business Restructure - the non-banking businesses held in the Australia Commercial and Institutional divisions were transferred to the Group
Centre division. As a result of this transfer, Group Centre division holds all interests in the ANZ Non-Bank Group.
• Corporate customer re-segmentation - certain business and property finance customers were transferred from the New Zealand division to the
Institutional division.
• Cost reallocations - certain costs were reallocated across the Australia Retail, Australia Commercial, Institutional and Group Centre divisions.
The reportable segments are divisions engaged in providing either different products or services or similar products and services in different
geographical areas. They are as follows:
Australia Retail
The Australia Retail division provides a full range of banking services to Australian consumers. This includes Home Loans, Deposits, Credit Cards and
Personal Loans. Products and services are provided via the branch network, home loan specialists, contact centres, a variety of self-service channels
(digital and internet banking, website, ATMs and phone banking) and third-party brokers. It also includes the costs related to the development and
operation of the ANZ Plus proposition for retail customers.
Australia Commercial
The Australia Commercial division provides a full range of banking products and financial services, including asset financing, across the following
customer segments: SME Banking (small business owners and medium commercial customers), and Specialist Business (large commercial customers,
and high net worth individuals and family groups).
Institutional
The Institutional division services global institutional and corporate customers, and governments across Australia, New Zealand and International
(including Papua New Guinea (PNG)) via the following business units:
• Transaction Banking provides customers with working capital and liquidity solutions including documentary trade, supply chain financing,
commodity financing as well as cash management solutions, deposits, payments and clearing.
• Corporate Finance provides customers with loan products, loan syndication, specialised loan structuring and execution, project and export
finance, debt structuring and acquisition finance and corporate advisory services.
• Markets provides customers with risk management services in foreign exchange, interest rates, credit, commodities, and debt capital markets in
addition to managing the Group's interest rate exposure and liquidity position.
New Zealand
The New Zealand division comprises the following business units:
• Personal provides a full range of banking and wealth management services to consumer and private banking customers. We deliver our services
via our internet and app-based digital solutions and a network of branches, mortgage specialists, relationship managers and contact centres.
• Business & Agri (previously Business) provides a full range of banking services through our digital, branch and contact centre channels, and
traditional relationship banking and sophisticated financial solutions through dedicated managers. These cover privately owned small, medium
and large enterprises, the agricultural business segment, government and government-related entities.
Pacific
The Pacific division provides products and services to retail and commercial customers (including multi-nationals) and to governments located in the
Pacific region, excluding PNG which forms part of the Institutional division.

Group Centre division provides support to the operating divisions, including technology, property, risk management, financial management, treasury,
strategy, marketing, human resources, corporate affairs, and shareholder functions. It also includes minority investments in Asia and interests in the
ANZ Non-Bank Group.

The reportable segments operate across three geographical regions as follows:
• Australia Retail division - Australia
• Australia Commercial division - Australia
• Institutional division - all three geographical regions
• New Zealand division - New Zealand

FINANCIAL ASSETS
Outlined below is a description of how we classify and measure financial assets as they apply to the note disclosures that follow.
CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT
Financial assets - general
There are three measurement classifications for financial assets under AASB 9: amortised cost, FVTPL and FVOCI. Financial assets are
classified into these measurement classifications on the basis of two criteria:
• the business model within which the financial asset is managed; and
• the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset (specifically whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments
of principal and interest).
The resultant financial asset classifications are as follows:
• Amortised cost: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest and which are held
in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows;
• FVOCI: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest and which are held in a
business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows or to sell the assets; and
• FVTPL: Any other financial assets not falling into the categories above are measured at FVTPL.
Fair value option for financial assets
A financial asset may be irrevocably designated on initial recognition:
• at FVTPL when the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise; or
• at FVOCI for investments in equity securities, where that instrument is neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognised
by an acquirer in a business combination.
9. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and other balances, as outlined below, that are convertible into cash with an insignificant risk of
changes in value and with remaining maturities of three months or less, including reverse repurchase agreements.

associated repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements being recognised and measured at FVTPL.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
Trading assets are financial instruments or other assets we either:
• acquire principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term; or
• hold as part of a portfolio we manage for short-term profit making.
Trading assets include commodity inventories measured at fair value less cost to sell in accordance with the broker trader exemption under
AASB 102 Inventories.
We recognise purchases and sales of trading assets on trade date:
• initially, we measure them at fair value; and
• subsequently, we measure them in the balance sheet at their fair value with any change in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
Assets disclosed as Trading assets are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for Financial Assets outlined at the
commencement of the Group’s financial assets disclosures on page 113.
KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
Judgement is required when applying the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of trading assets not valued using quoted
market prices. Refer to Note 19 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities for further details.

Derivative financial instruments 60,406 (57,482) 90,174 (85,149)
FEATURES
Derivative financial instruments are contracts:
• whose value is derived from an underlying price index (or other variable) defined in the contract - sometimes the value is derived from more than
one variable;
• that require little or no initial net investment; and
• that are settled at a future date.
Movements in the price of the underlying variables, which cause the value of the contract to fluctuate, are reflected in the fair value of the derivative.
PURPOSE
The Group’s derivative financial instruments have been categorised as following:
Trading Derivatives held in order to:
• meet customer needs for managing their own risks.
• manage risks in the Group that are not in a designated hedge accounting relationship (some elements of balance
sheet management).
• undertake market making and positioning activities to generate profits from short-term fluctuations in prices
or margins.
Designated in Hedging Derivatives designated into hedge accounting relationships in order to minimise profit or loss volatility by matching
Relationships movements in underlying positions relating to:
• hedges of the Group’s exposures to interest rate risk and currency risk.
• hedges of other exposures relating to non-trading positions.
TYPES
The Group offers or uses four different types of derivative financial instruments:
Forwards A contract documenting the rate of interest, or the currency exchange rate, to be paid or received on a notional
principal amount at a future date.
Futures An exchange traded contract in which the parties agree to buy or sell an asset in the future for a price agreed on the
transaction date, with a net settlement in cash paid on the future date without physical delivery of the asset.
Swaps A contract in which two parties exchange one series of cash flows for another.
Options A contract in which the buyer of the contract has the right - but not the obligation - to buy (known as a ‘call option’)
or to sell (known as a ‘put option’) an asset or instrument at a set price on a future date. The seller has the
corresponding obligation to fulfil the transaction to sell or buy the asset or instrument if the buyer exercises
the option.

RISKS MANAGED
The Group offers and uses the instruments described above to manage fluctuations in the following market factors:
Foreign Exchange Currencies at current or determined rates of exchange.
Interest Rate Fixed or variable interest rates applying to money lent, deposited or borrowed.
Commodity Soft commodities (that is, agricultural products such as wheat, coffee, cocoa and sugar) and hard commodities (that
is, mined products such as gold, oil and gas).
Credit Risk of default by customers or third parties.
The Group uses a number of central clearing counterparties and exchanges to settle derivative transactions. Different arrangements for posting of
collateral exist with these exchanges:
• some transactions are subject to clearing arrangements which result in separate recognition of collateral assets and liabilities, with the carrying
values of the associated derivative assets and liabilities held at their fair value.
• other transactions, are legally settled by the payment or receipt of collateral which reduces the carrying values of the related derivative instruments
by the amount paid or received.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
Recognition Initially and at each reporting date, we recognise all derivatives at fair value. If the fair value of a
derivative is positive, then we carry it as an asset, but if its value is negative, then we carry it as a
liability.
Valuation adjustments are integral in determining the fair value of derivatives. This includes:
• a credit valuation adjustment to reflect the counterparty risk and/or event of default; and
• a funding valuation adjustment to account for funding costs and benefits in the derivatives
portfolio.
Derecognition of We remove derivative assets from our Balance Sheet when the contracts expire or we have transferred
assets and liabilities substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. We remove derivative liabilities from our Balance
Sheet when the Group’s contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
With respect to derivatives cleared through a central clearing counterparty or exchange, derivative
assets or liabilities may be derecognised in accordance with the principle above when collateral is
settled, depending on the legal arrangements in place for each instrument.
Impact on the The recognition of gains or losses on derivative financial instruments depends on whether the
Income Statement derivative is held for trading or is designated in a hedge accounting relationship. For derivative
financial instruments held for trading, gains or losses from changes in the fair value are recognised in
profit or loss.
For an instrument designated in a hedge accounting relationship, the recognition of gains or losses
depends on the nature of the item being hedged. Refer to the table on page 117 for details of the
recognition approach applied for each type of hedge accounting relationship.
Sources of hedge accounting ineffectiveness may arise from differences in the interest rate reference
rate, margins, or rate set differences and differences in discounting between the hedged items and the
hedging instruments.
Hedge effectiveness To qualify for hedge accounting under AASB 139, a hedge relationship is expected to be highly
effective. A hedge relationship is highly effective only if the following conditions are met:
• the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash
flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period for which the hedge is designated
(prospective effectiveness); and
• the actual results of the hedge are within the range of 80-125% (retrospective effectiveness).
The Group monitors hedge effectiveness on a regular basis but at a minimum at each reporting date.
KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
Judgement is required when we select the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of derivatives, particularly the selection of
valuation inputs that are not readily observable, and the application of valuation adjustments to certain derivatives. Refer to Note 19 Fair
Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities for further details.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
Investment securities are those financial assets in security form (that is, transferable debt or equity instruments) that are not held for trading
purposes. By way of exception, bills of exchange (a form of security/transferable instrument) which are used to facilitate the Group’s
customer lending activities are classified as Loans and advances (rather than Investment securities) to better reflect the substance of the
arrangement.
Equity investments not held for trading purposes may be designated at FVOCI on an instrument by instrument basis. If this election is
made, gains or losses are not reclassified from Other comprehensive income to profit or loss on disposal of the investment. However, gains
or losses may be reclassified within equity.
Assets disclosed as Investment securities are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for Financial Assets outlined at
the commencement of the Group’s financial asset disclosures on page 113. Additionally, expected credit losses associated with ‘Investment
securities - debt securities at amortised cost’ and ‘Investment securities - debt securities at FVOCI’ are recognised and measured in
accordance with the accounting policy outlined in Note 14 Allowance for Expected Credit Losses. For ‘Investment securities - debt
securities at FVOCI’, the allowance for Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is recognised in the FVOCI reserve in equity with a corresponding charge
to profit or loss.
KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
Judgement is required when we select valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of assets not valued using quoted market
prices, particularly the selection of valuation inputs that are not readily observable. Refer to Note 19 Fair Value of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities for further details.

1. During 2023, the Group commenced the management of repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements on a fair value basis within the trading book in its Markets business. This resulted in
the associated repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements being recognised and measured at FVTPL.
2. Amortised over the expected life of the loan.
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
Loans and advances are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and
are facilities the Group provides directly to customers or through third party channels.
Loans and advances are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the loan or advance,
which are primarily brokerage and other origination costs which we amortise over the estimated life of the loan. Subsequently, we then
measure loans and advances at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, or
at fair value when they are specifically designated on initial recognition as FVTPL, are classified as held for sale or when held for trading.
Refer to Note 19 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities for further details.
We classify contracts to lease assets and hire purchase agreements as finance leases if they transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of the asset to the customer or an unrelated third party. We include these facilities in ‘Other’ in the table above.
The Group enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets that are recognised on its Balance Sheet. When the Group retains
substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets remain on the Group’s Balance Sheet, however if
substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred, the Group derecognises the asset. If the risks and rewards are partially retained and
control over the asset is lost, the Group derecognises the asset. If control over the asset is not lost, the Group continues to recognise the
asset to the extent of its continuing involvement.
We separately recognise the rights and obligations retained, or created, in the transfer of assets as appropriate.
Assets disclosed as Net loans and advances are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for financial assets outlined on
page 113. Additionally, expected credit losses associated with loans and advances at amortised cost are recognised and measured in
accordance with the accounting policy outlined in Note 14 Allowance for Expected Credit Losses.

14. ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS MODEL
The measurement of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased, probability weighted prediction which evaluates a range of scenarios and
takes into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.
Expected credit losses are either measured over 12 months or the expected lifetime of the financial asset, depending on credit
deterioration since origination, according to the following three-stage approach:
• Stage 1: At the origination of a financial asset, and where there has not been a Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) since origination,
an allowance for ECL is recognised reflecting the expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next
12 months from the reporting date. For instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, expected credit losses are
estimated based on default events that are possible over the remaining time to maturity.
• Stage 2: Where there has been a SICR since origination, an allowance for ECL is recognised reflecting expected credit losses resulting
from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. If credit risk were to improve in a subsequent period
such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant, the exposure returns to a Stage 1 classification
with ECL measured accordingly.
• Stage 3: Where there is objective evidence of impairment, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised.
Expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2, and on either a collective or individual basis
when transferred to Stage 3.
MEASUREMENT OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS
ECL is calculated as the product of the following credit risk factors at a facility level, discounted to incorporate the time value of money:
• Probability of default (PD) - the estimate of the likelihood that a borrower will default over a given period;
• Exposure at default (EAD) - the expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and interest,
expected additional drawdowns and accrued interest; and
• Loss given default (LGD) - the expected loss in the event of the borrower defaulting, expressed as a percentage of the facility's EAD,
taking into account direct and indirect recovery costs.
These credit risk factors are adjusted for current and forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic variables.
EXPECTED LIFE
When estimating ECL for exposures in Stage 2 and 3, the Group considers the expected lifetime over which it is exposed to credit risk.
For non-retail portfolios, the Group uses the maximum contractual period as the expected lifetime for non-revolving credit facilities. For
non-retail revolving credit facilities, such as corporate lines of credit, the expected life reflects the Group’s contractual right to withdraw a
facility as part of a contractually agreed annual review, after taking into account the applicable notice period.
For retail portfolios, the expected lifetime is determined using a behavioural term, taking into account expected prepayment behaviour
and events that give rise to substantial modifications.
DEFINITION OF DEFAULT, CREDIT IMPAIRED AND WRITE-OFFS
The definition of default used in measuring ECL is aligned to the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes across all
portfolios. This definition is also in line with the regulatory definition of default. Default occurs when there are indicators that a debtor is
unlikely to fully satisfy contractual credit obligations to the Group, or the exposure is 90 days past due.
Financial assets, including those that are well secured, are considered credit impaired for financial reporting purposes when they default.
When there is no realistic probability of recovery, loans are written off against the related impairment allowance on completion of the
Group’s internal processes and when all reasonably expected recoveries have been collected. In subsequent periods, any recoveries of
amounts previously written-off are recorded as a release to the credit impairment charge in the income statement.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT (continued)
MODIFIED FINANCIAL ASSETS
If the contractual terms of a financial asset are modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one for either credit or
commercial reasons, an assessment is made to determine if the changes to the terms of the existing financial asset are considered
substantial. This assessment considers both changes in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as changes in the overall
instrument risk profile; for example, changes in the principal (credit limit), term, or type of underlying collateral. Where a modification is
considered non-substantial, the existing financial asset is not derecognised and its date of origination continues to be used to determine
SICR. Where a modification is considered substantial, the existing financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at
its fair value on the modification date, which also becomes the date of origination used to determine SICR for this new asset.
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CREDIT RISK (SICR)
Stage 2 assets are those that have experienced a SICR since origination. In determining what constitutes a SICR, the Group considers both
qualitative and quantitative information:
i. Internal credit rating grade
For the majority of portfolios, the primary indicator of a SICR is a significant deterioration in the internal credit rating grade of a facility
since origination and is measured by application of thresholds.
For non-retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing the Customer Credit Rating (CCR) applicable to a facility at reporting date
to the CCR at origination of that facility. A CCR is assigned to each borrower which reflects the PD of the borrower and incorporates
both borrower and non-borrower specific information, including forward-looking information. CCRs are subject to review at least
annually or more frequently when an event occurs which could affect the credit risk of the customer.
For retail portfolios, a SICR is determined, depending on the type of facility, by either comparing the scenario weighted lifetime PD at
the reporting date to that at origination, or by reference to customer behavioural score thresholds. The scenario weighted lifetime
probability of default may increase significantly if:
• there has been a deterioration in the economic outlook, or an increase in economic uncertainty; or
• there has been a deterioration in the customer’s overall credit position, or ability to manage their credit obligations.
ii. Backstop criteria
The Group uses 30 days past due arrears as a backstop criterion for both non-retail and retail portfolios. For retail portfolios only,
facilities are required to demonstrate three to six months of good payment behaviour prior to being allocated back to Stage 1.
FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
Forward-looking information is incorporated into both our assessment of whether a financial asset has experienced a SICR since origination
and in our estimate of ECL. In applying forward-looking information for estimating ECL, the Group considers four probability-weighted
forecast economic scenarios as follows:
i. Base case scenario
The base case scenario is ANZ’s view of future macroeconomic conditions. It reflects management’s assumptions used for strategic
planning and budgeting, and also informs the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) which is the process the
Group applies in strategic and capital planning over a 3-year time horizon;
ii. Upside and iii. Downside scenarios
The upside and downside scenarios are fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions (that is, they are not based on the
economic conditions prevailing at balance date) and are based on a combination of more optimistic (in the case of the upside) and
pessimistic (in the case of the downside) economic events and uncertainty over long term horizons; and
iv. Severe downside scenario
To better reflect the current economic conditions and geopolitical environment, the Group altered the severe downside scenario in
2022 from a scenario fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions to one which aligns with the scenario used for Group-
wide stress testing.

14. ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT (continued)
FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION (continued)
The four scenarios are described in terms of macroeconomic variables used in the PD, LGD and EAD models (collectively the ECL models)
depending on the lending portfolio and country of the borrower. Examples of the macroeconomic variables include unemployment rates,
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates, residential property price indices, commercial property price indices and consumer price
indices.
Probability weighting of each scenario is determined by management considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case
economic scenario, as well as specific portfolio considerations where required. The Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO) is
responsible for reviewing and approving the base case economic scenario and the Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC) approves the
probability weights applied to each scenario.
Where applicable, temporary adjustments may be made to account for situations where known or expected risks have not been adequately
addressed in the modelling process. CMRC is responsible for approving such adjustments.
KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
Collectively assessed allowance for expected credit losses
In estimating collectively assessed ECL, the Group makes judgements and assumptions in relation to:
• the selection of an estimation technique or modelling methodology; and
• the selection of inputs for those models, and the interdependencies between those inputs.
The following table summarises the key judgements and assumptions in relation to the model inputs and the interdependencies between
those inputs, and highlights significant changes during the current period.
The judgements and associated assumptions have been made within the context of the uncertainty as to how various factors might
impact the global economy and reflect historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant, including expectations of
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Group’s ECL estimates are inherently uncertain and, as a
result, actual results may differ from these estimates.

Credit Risk has occurred a SICR since initial recognition of a loan, which

an allowance based on the probability of default
(PD) in the next 12 months, to an allowance for
lifetime expected credit losses. Subsequent
decreases in credit risk resulting in transition
from Stage 2 to Stage 1 may similarly result in
significant changes in the ECL allowance.
The setting of precise SICR trigger points

impact upon the size of the ECL allowance. The

Continuing uncertainties described above increase the risk of the economic forecast resulting in an understatement or overstatement of
the ECL balance.
The economic drivers of the base case economic forecasts, reflective of ANZ Economics’ view of future macroeconomic conditions used at

The base case economic forecasts for Australia, New Zealand and Rest of World are for continuing slowdowns in economic activity.
Continued high inflation in Australia and New Zealand is expected to keep interest rates high and dampen growth over the forecast
period.
Probability weightings
Probability weightings for each scenario are determined by management considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the base
case economic scenario including the uncertainties described above.
The average base case weighting has increased to 45.9% (Sep 22: 45%) as the downside and severe downside scenario weightings have
been revised. The average downside case weighting has increased to 41.2% (Sep 22: 40%), and the average severe downside case
weighting has decreased to 12.9% (Sep 22: 15%).
The assigned probability weightings in Australia, New Zealand and Rest of World are subject to a high degree of inherent uncertainty and
therefore the actual outcomes may be significantly different to those projected. The Group considers these weightings in each geography
to provide estimates of the possible loss outcomes and taking into account short and long term inter-relationships within the Group’s
credit portfolios. The average weightings applied across the Group are set out below:

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Outlined below is a description of how we classify and measure financial liabilities relevant to the note disclosures that follow.
CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, or FVTPL when they are held for trading. Additionally, financial liabilities can be
designated at FVTPL where:
• the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise;
• a group of financial liabilities are managed and their performance are evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented
risk management strategy; or
• the financial liability contains one or more embedded derivatives unless:
a) the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract; or
b) the embedded derivative is closely related to the host financial liability.
Where financial liabilities are designated as measured at fair value, gains or losses relating to changes in the entity’s own credit risk are
included in Other comprehensive income, except where doing so would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss.

1. During 2023, the Group commenced the management of repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements on a fair value basis within the trading book in its Markets business. This resulted in
the associated repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements being recognised and measured at FVTPL.
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
For deposits and other borrowings that:
• are not designated at FVTPL on initial recognition, we measure them at amortised cost and recognise their interest expense using the
effective interest rate method; and
• are managed on a fair value basis, reduce or eliminate an accounting mismatch or contain an embedded derivative, we designate them
as measured at FVTPL.
Refer to Note 19 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities for further details.
For deposits and other borrowings designated at fair value we recognise the amount of fair value gain or loss attributable to changes in
the Group’s own credit risk in Other comprehensive income in retained earnings. Any remaining amount of fair value gain or loss we
recognise directly in profit or loss. Once we have recognised an amount in other comprehensive income, we do not later reclassify it to
profit or loss.
Securities sold under repurchase agreements represent a liability to repurchase the financial assets that remain on our balance sheet since
the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the Group. Over the life of the repurchase agreement, we recognise the difference
between the sale price and the repurchase price and charge it to interest expense in profit or loss.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
The Group recognises liabilities when there is a present obligation to transfer economic resources as a result of past events.
Below is the measurement basis for each item classified as other liabilities:
• Payables, accruals and other liabilities are measured at the contractual amount payable or the best estimate of consideration required to
settle the payable.
• Liabilities at fair value relate to securities sold short, which we classify as held for trading and measure at FVTPL based on quoted prices
in active markets.
• Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate at
the lease commencement date. The carrying amount is then subsequently adjusted to reflect the interest on the lease liability, lease
payments that have been made and any lease reassessments or modifications.
• Trail commission liabilities are measured based on the present value of expected future trail commission payments taking into
consideration average behavioural loan life and outstanding balances of broker originated loans.

17. DEBT ISSUANCES
The Group, primarily via ANZBGL or other banking subsidiaries, uses a variety of funding programmes to issue senior debt (including covered bonds
and securitisations) and subordinated debt. The difference between senior debt and subordinated debt is that holders of senior debt of a Group issuer
take priority over holders of subordinated debt owed by that issuer. In the winding up of a Group issuer, the subordinated debt will be repaid by the
relevant issuer only after the repayment of claims of its depositors, other creditors and the senior debt holders of that issuer.

SUBORDINATED DEBT
Subordinated debt is issued by the Group out of its banking subsidiaries, ANZBGL and ANZ Bank New Zealand. The subordinated debt constitutes
subordinated debt of both the Group and the relevant issuer but does not constitute regulatory capital for the Group.
At 30 September 2023, all subordinated debt issued by ANZBGL (other than ANZBGL’s USD 300 million perpetual subordinated notes) qualifies as
regulatory capital for ANZBGL. Depending on their terms and conditions, the subordinated debt instruments issued by ANZBGL are classified as either
Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital for ANZBGL (in the case of the ANZ Capital Notes (ANZ CN) and ANZ Capital Securities (ANZ CS)) or Tier 2 capital for
ANZBGL (in the case of the term subordinated notes) for APRA’s capital adequacy purposes.
Subordinated debt issued externally by ANZ Bank New Zealand will constitute Tier 2 capital for ANZ Bank New Zealand for the purposes of the Reserve
Bank of New Zealand’s (RBNZ) capital requirements.

AT1 Capital
All outstanding AT1 capital instruments issued by ANZBGL are Basel III fully compliant instruments (refer to Note 25 Capital Management for further
information about Basel III) for APRA’s capital adequacy purposes. Each of the ANZ CN and ANZ CS rank equally with each other.
Distributions on the AT1 capital instruments are non-cumulative and subject to the issuer’s absolute discretion and certain payment conditions
(including regulatory requirements). Distributions on ANZ CNs are franked in line with the franking applied to ANZGHL’s ordinary shares.
Where specified, the AT1 capital instruments provide the issuer with an early redemption or conversion option on a specified date and in certain other
circumstances (such as a tax or regulatory event). This redemption option is subject to APRA’s prior written approval.
Each of the AT1 capital instruments will immediately convert into a variable number of ANZGHL’s ordinary shares (based on the average market price
of the shares immediately prior to conversion less a 1% discount, subject to a maximum conversion number of ANZGHL’s ordinary shares) if:
• ANZBGL’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratios are equal to or less than 5.125% - known as a Common Equity Capital Trigger Event; or
• APRA notifies ANZBGL that, without the conversion or write-off of certain securities or a public sector injection of capital (or equivalent support), it
considers that ANZBGL would become non-viable – known as a Non-Viability Trigger Event.
Where specified, AT1 capital instruments mandatorily convert into a variable number of ANZGHL’s ordinary shares (based on the average market price
of the shares immediately prior to conversion less a 1% discount):
• on a specified mandatory conversion date; or
• on an earlier date under certain circumstances as set out in the terms.
However, the mandatory conversion is deferred for a specified period if certain conversion tests are not met.
If the AT1 capital securities convert, and the holders receive ANZGHL ordinary shares, then:
• the AT1 capital securities are transferred to ANZGHL for their face value;
• ANZBGL shall redeem the securities and simultaneously issue ordinary shares to its parent ANZ BH Limited (based on its share price calculated by
reference to its consolidated net assets, subject to a maximum conversion number); and
• ANZ BH Limited will issue shares to ANZGHL (calculated on the same basis).
Preference shares issued externally by ANZ Bank New Zealand will constitute additional tier 1 capital for ANZ Bank New Zealand for the purposes of
the RBNZ’s capital requirements, however they will not constitute Additional Tier 1 capital for the ANZBGL Group as the terms of the preference shares
do not satisfy APRA’s capital requirements. The preference shares are included within non-controlling interests in Note 24 Shareholders’ Equity.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
Debt issuances are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, except where designated at FVTPL.
Interest expense on debt issuances is recognised using the effective interest rate method. Where the Group enters into a fair value hedge
accounting relationship, the fair value attributable to the hedged risk is reflected in adjustments to the carrying value of the debt.
Subordinated debt with capital-based conversion features (i.e. Common Equity Capital Trigger Events or Non-Viability Trigger Events) are
considered to contain embedded derivatives that we account for separately at FVTPL. The embedded derivatives arise because the
amount of shares issued on conversion following any of those trigger events is subject to the maximum conversion number, however they
have no significant value as of the reporting date given the remote nature of those trigger events.

INTRODUCTION
The use of financial instruments is fundamental to the Group’s businesses of providing banking and other financial services to our customers. The
associated financial risks (primarily credit, market, and liquidity risks) are a significant portion of the Group’s key material risks.
We disclose details of all key material risks impacting the Group, and further information on the Group’s risk management activities, in the Governance
and Risk Management sections of this Annual Report.
This note details the Group’s financial risk management policies, processes and quantitative disclosures in relation to the key financial risks.

• Collateral management
Credit risk incorporates the risks associated with us lending to
customers who could be impacted by climate change, changes to
laws, regulations, or other policies adopted by governments or
regulatory authorities. Climate change impacts include both
physical risks (climate- or weather-related events) and transition
risks resulting from the adjustment to a low emissions
economy. Transition risks include resultant changes to laws,
regulations and policies noted above.

OVERVIEW
AN OVERVIEW OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
This overview is provided to aid the users of the financial statements in understanding the context of the financial disclosures required under AASB 7
Financial Instruments: Disclosures. It should be read in conjunction with the Governance and Risk Management sections of this Annual Report.
The Board is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Group’s Risk Management Framework (RMF). The Board has delegated authority to the
Board Risk Committee (BRC) to develop and monitor compliance with the Group’s risk management policies. The BRC reports regularly to the Board
on its activities.
The Board approves the strategic objectives of the Group including:
• the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which sets out the Board’s expectations regarding the degree of risk that the Group is prepared to accept in
pursuit of its strategic objectives and business plan; and
• the Risk Management Strategy (RMS), which describes the Group’s strategy for managing risks and the key elements of the RMF that give effect to
this strategy. This includes a description of each material risk, and an overview of how the RMF addresses each risk, with reference to the relevant
policies, standards and procedures. It also includes information on how the Group identifies, measures, evaluates, monitors, reports and controls or
mitigates material risks.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and robust control environment in which
all employees understand their roles and obligations. At ANZ, risk is everyone’s responsibility.
The Group has an independent risk management function, headed by the Chief Risk Officer who:
• is responsible for overseeing the risk profile and the risk management framework;
• can effectively challenge activities and decisions that materially affect the Group’s risk profile; and
• has an independent reporting line to the BRC to enable the appropriate escalation of issues of concern.
The Internal Audit Function reports directly to the Board Audit Committee (BAC). Internal Audit provides:
• an independent evaluation of the Group’s RMF annually that seeks to ensure compliance with, and the effectiveness of, the risk management
framework;
• facilitation of a comprehensive review every three years that seeks to ensure the appropriateness, effectiveness and adequacy of the risk
management framework; and
• recommendations to improve the framework and/or work practices to strengthen the effectiveness of day-to-day operations.

CREDIT RISK
CREDIT RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES
Granting credit facilities to customers is one of the Group’s major sources of income. As this activity is also a principal risk, the Group dedicates
considerable resources to its management. The Group assumes credit risk in a wide range of lending and other activities in diverse markets and in
many jurisdictions. Credit risks arise from traditional lending to customers as well as from interbank, treasury, trade finance and capital markets
activities around the world.
Our credit risk management framework ensures we apply a consistent approach across the Group when we measure, monitor and manage the credit
risk appetite set by the Board. The Board is assisted and advised by the BRC in discharging its duty to oversee credit risk. The BRC:
• sets the credit risk appetite and credit strategies; and
• approves credit transactions beyond the discretion of executive management.
We quantify credit risk through an internal credit rating system (masterscales) to ensure consistency across exposure types and to provide a consistent
framework for reporting and analysis. The system uses models and other tools to measure the following for customer exposures:
Probability of Default (PD) Expressed by a Customer Credit Rating (CCR), reflecting the Group’s assessment of a customer’s ability
to service and repay debt.
Exposure at Default (EAD) The expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and
interest, expected additional drawdowns and accrued interest at the time of default.
Loss Given Default (LGD) Expressed by a Security Indicator (SI) ranging from A to G. The SI is calculated by reference to the
percentage of loan covered by security which the Group can realise if a customer defaults. The A-G
scale is supplemented by a range of other SIs which cover factors such as cash cover and sovereign
backing. For retail and some small business lending, we group exposures into large homogenous pools
– and the LGD is assigned at the pool level.
Our specialist credit risk teams develop and validate the Group’s PD and LGD rating models. The outputs from these models drive our day-to-day
credit risk management decisions including origination, pricing, approval levels, regulatory capital adequacy, economic capital allocation, and credit
provisioning.
All customers with whom the Group has a credit relationship are assigned a CCR at origination via either of the following assessment approaches:
Large and more complex lending Retail and some small business lending
Rating models provide a consistent and structured assessment, with Automated assessment of credit applications using a combination of

MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK
For financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount. In certain circumstances there may
be differences between the carrying amounts reported on the balance sheet and the amounts reported in the tables below. Principally, these
differences arise in respect of financial assets that are subject to risks other than credit risk, such as equity instruments which are primarily subject to
market risk, or bank notes and coins.
For undrawn facilities, this maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount of the committed facilities. For contingent exposures, the maximum
exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount the Group would have to pay if the instrument is called upon.
The table below shows our maximum exposure to credit risk of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions before taking account of any
collateral held or other credit enhancements.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Credit risk becomes concentrated when a number of customers are engaged in similar activities, have similar economic characteristics, or have similar
activities within the same geographic region – therefore, they may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. The Group
monitors its credit portfolio to manage risk concentration and rebalance the portfolio. The Group also applies single customer counterparty limits to
protect against unacceptably large exposures to one single customer.

CREDIT RISK (continued)
COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT
We use collateral for on and off-balance sheet exposures to mitigate credit risk if a counterparty cannot meet its repayment obligations. Where there is
sufficient collateral, an expected credit loss is not recognised. This is largely the case for certain lending products, such as margin loans and reverse
repurchase agreements that are secured by the securities purchased using the lending. For some products, the collateral provided by customers is
fundamental to the product’s structuring, so it is not strictly the secondary source of repayment - for example, lending secured by trade receivables is
typically repaid by the collection of those receivables. During the period there was no change in our collateral policies.
The nature of collateral or security held for the relevant classes of financial assets is as follows:
Net loans and advances
Loans - housing and Housing loans are secured by mortgage(s) over property and additional security may take the form of
personal guarantees and deposits.
Personal lending (including credit cards and overdrafts) is predominantly unsecured. If we take security, then
it is restricted to eligible vehicles, motor homes and other assets.
Loans - business Business loans may be secured, partially secured or unsecured. Typically, we take security by way of a
mortgage over property and/or a charge over the business or other assets.
If appropriate, we may take other security to mitigate the credit risk, such as guarantees, standby letters of
credit or derivative protection.
Other financial assets
Trading assets, Investment For trading assets, we do not seek collateral directly from the issuer or counterparty. However, the collateral
securities, Derivatives and may be implicit in the terms of the instrument (for example, with an asset-backed security). The terms of
Other financial assets debt securities may include collateralisation.
For derivatives, we typically terminate all contracts with the counterparty and settle on a net basis at market
levels current at the time of a counterparty default under International Swaps and Derivatives Association
(ISDA) Master Agreements.
Our preferred practice is to use a Credit Support Annex (CSA) to the ISDA so that open derivative positions
with the counterparty are aggregated and cash collateral (or other forms of eligible collateral) is exchanged
daily. The collateral is provided by the counterparty when their position is out of the money (or provided to
the counterparty by ANZ when our position is out of the money).
Off-balance sheet positions
Undrawn and contingent Collateral for off-balance sheet positions is mainly held against undrawn facilities, and they are typically
facilities performance bonds or guarantees. Undrawn facilities that are secured include housing loans secured by
mortgages over residential property and business lending secured by commercial real estate and/or charges
over business assets.

MARKET RISK
MARKET RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES
Market risk stems from the Group’s trading and balance sheet management activities and the impact of changes and correlations between interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, commodities, equities and the volatility within these asset classes.
The BRC delegates responsibility for day-to-day management of both market risks and compliance with market risk policies to the Credit and Market
Risk Committee (CMRC) and the Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO).
Within overall strategies and policies established by the BRC, business units and risk management have joint responsibility for the control of market
risk at the Group level. The Market Risk team (a specialist risk management unit independent of the business) allocates market risk limits at various
levels and monitors and reports on them daily. This detailed framework allocates individual limits to manage and control exposures using risk factors
and profit and loss limits.
Management, measurement and reporting of market risk is undertaken in two broad categories:
Traded Market Risk Non-Traded Market Risk
Risk of loss from changes in the value of financial instruments due Risk of loss associated with the management of non-traded interest rate risk,
to movements in price factors for both physical and derivative liquidity risk and foreign exchange exposures. This includes interest rate risk
trading positions. Principal risk categories monitored are: in the banking book. This risk of loss arises from adverse changes in the
1. Currency risk – potential loss arising from changes in foreign overall and relative level of interest rates for different tenors, differences in
exchange rates or their implied volatilities. the actual versus expected net interest margin, and the potential valuation
risk associated with embedded options in financial instruments and bank
2. Interest rate risk – potential loss from changes in market interest
products.
rates or their implied volatilities.
3. Credit spread risk – potential loss arising from a movement in
margin or spread relative to a benchmark.
4. Commodity risk – potential loss arising from changes in
commodity prices or their implied volatilities.
5. Equity risk – potential loss arising from changes in equity prices.
MEASUREMENT OF MARKET RISK
We primarily manage and control market risk using Value at Risk (VaR), sensitivity analysis and stress testing.
VaR measures the Group’s possible daily loss based on historical market movements. The Group’s VaR approach for both traded and non-traded risk is
historical simulation. We use historical changes in market rates, prices and volatilities over a 500 business day window using a one-day holding period.
Back testing is used to ensure our VaR models remain accurate.
ANZ measures VaR at a 99% confidence interval which means there is a 99% chance that a loss will not exceed the VaR for the relevant holding period.

Non-traded market risk
Balance sheet risk management
The principal objectives of balance sheet risk management are to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to mitigate the negative
impact of movements in interest rates on the earnings and market value of the Group’s banking book, while ensuring the Group maintains sufficient
liquidity to meet its obligations as they fall due.
Interest rate risk management
Non-traded interest rate risk relates to the potential adverse impact of changes in market interest rates on the Group’s future Net interest income. This
risk arises from two principal sources, namely mismatches between the repricing dates of interest bearing assets and liabilities; and the investment of
capital and other non-interest bearing liabilities and assets. Interest rate risk is reported using VaR and scenario analysis (based on the impact of a 1%
rate shock). The table below shows VaR figures for non-traded interest rate risk for the combined Group as well as Australia, New Zealand and Rest of
World geographies which are calculated separately.

which assumes the parallel shift is reflected in all wholesale and customer rates.
The table below shows the outcome of this risk measure for the current and previous financial years, expressed as a percentage of reported Net
interest income.
2023 2022
Impact of 1% rate shock on the next 12 months' net interest income
As at period end 0.96% 1.29%
Maximum exposure 1.17% 2.08%
Minimum exposure 0.38% 1.15%
Average exposure (in absolute terms) 0.80% 1.56%
EQUITY SECURITIES DESIGNATED AT FVOCI
Our investment securities contain equity investment holdings which predominantly comprise Bank of Tianjin and equity holding in the 1835i Ventures
Trust business unit. The market risk impact on these equity investments is not captured by the Group’s VaR processes for traded and non-traded
market risks. Therefore, the Group regularly reviews the valuations of the investments within the portfolio and assesses whether the investments are
appropriately measured based on the recognition and measurement policies set out in Note 12 Investment Securities.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK – STRUCTURAL EXPOSURES
Our investment of capital in foreign operations - for example, branches, subsidiaries or associates with functional currencies other than the Australian
Dollar - exposes the Group to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates. Variations in the value of these foreign operations arising as a result of
exchange differences are reflected in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. Where considered appropriate, the Group enters into hedges
of the foreign exchange exposures from its foreign operations.
Similarly, the Group may enter into economic hedges against larger foreign exchange denominated revenue streams (primarily New Zealand Dollar,
US Dollar and US Dollar correlated). The primary objective of hedging is to ensure that, if practical, the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on
the consolidated capital ratios are minimised.

LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK
LIQUIDITY RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is either:
• unable to meet its payment obligations (including repaying depositors or maturing wholesale debt) when they fall due; or
• does not have the appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to fund increases in its assets.
Management of liquidity and funding risks are overseen by GALCO. The Group’s liquidity and funding risks are governed by a set of principles
approved by the BRC and include:
• maintaining the ability to meet all payment obligations in the immediate term;
• ensuring that the Group has the ability to meet ‘survival horizons’ under a range of ANZ specific, and general market, liquidity stress scenarios, at a
country and Group-wide level, to meet cash flow obligations over the short to medium term;
• maintaining strength in the Group’s balance sheet structure to ensure long term resilience in the liquidity and funding risk profile;
• ensuring the liquidity management framework is compatible with local regulatory requirements;
• preparing daily liquidity reports and scenario analysis to quantify the Group’s positions;
• targeting a diversified funding base to avoid undue concentrations by investor type, maturity, market source and currency;
• holding a portfolio of high quality liquid assets to protect against adverse funding conditions and to support day-to-day operations; and
• establishing detailed contingency plans to cover different liquidity crisis events.
Following the Restructure on 3 January 2023, the Group has operated under a non-operating holding company structure whereby:
• ANZBGL’s liquidity risk management framework remains unchanged and continues to operate its own liquidity and funding program, governance
frameworks and reporting regime reflecting its authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI) operations;
• ANZGHL (parent entity) has no material liquidity risk given the structure and nature of the balance sheet; and
• ANZ Non-Bank Group is not expected to have separate funding arrangements and will rely on ANZGHL for funding.
A separate liquidity policy has been established for ANZGHL and ANZ Bank Group to reflect the differing nature of liquidity risk inherent in each
business model. ANZGHL will ensure that the parent entity and ANZ Non-Bank Group holds sufficient cash reserves to meet operating and financing
requirements.
KEY AREAS OF MEASUREMENT FOR LIQUIDITY RISK
Scenario modelling of funding sources
ANZBGL Group’s liquidity risk appetite is defined by a range of regulatory and internal liquidity metrics mandated by the ANZBGL Board. The metrics
cover a range of scenarios of varying duration and level of severity.
The objective of this framework is to:
• Provide protection against shorter term extreme market dislocation and stress.
• Maintain structural strength in the balance sheet by ensuring that an appropriate amount of longer-term assets are funded with longer-term
funding.
• Ensure that no undue timing concentrations exist in the ANZBGL Group’s funding profile.
Key components of this framework are the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is a severe short term liquidity stress scenario and Net Stable Funding
Ratio (NSFR) a longer term structural liquidity measure, both of which are mandated by banking regulators including APRA.
Liquid assets
ANZBGL Group holds a portfolio of high quality (unencumbered) liquid assets to protect ANZBGL Group’s liquidity position in a severely stressed
environment and to meet regulatory requirements. High quality liquid assets comprise three categories consistent with Basel III LCR requirements:
• Highest-quality liquid assets - cash and highest credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities eligible for repurchase with
central banks to provide same-day liquidity.
• High-quality liquid assets - high credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities, high quality corporate debt securities and high
quality covered bonds eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity.
• Alternative liquid assets (ALA) - eligible securities that the RBNZ will accept in its domestic market operations and asset qualifying as collateral for
the CLF.
ANZBGL Group monitors and manages the size and composition of its liquid assets portfolio on an ongoing basis in line with regulatory requirements
and the risk appetite set by the ANZBGL Board.

Liquidity crisis contingency planning
ANZBGL Group maintains APRA-endorsed liquidity crisis contingency plans for analysing and responding to a liquidity threatening event at a country
and ANZBGL Group-wide level. Key liquidity contingency crisis planning requirements and guidelines include:
Ongoing business management Early signs/ mild stress Severe stress
• establish crisis/severity levels • monitoring and review • activate contingency funding plans
• liquidity limits • management actions not requiring • management actions for altering asset and liability
• early warning indicators business rationalisation behaviour
Assigned responsibility for internal and external communications and the appropriate timing to communicate
Since the precise nature of any stress event cannot be known in advance, we design the plans to be flexible to the nature and severity of the stress
event with multiple variables able to be accommodated in any plan.
Group funding
ANZBGL Group monitors the composition and stability of its funding so that it remains within the ANZBGL Group’s funding risk appetite. This
approach ensures that an appropriate proportion of the ANZBGL Group’s assets are funded by stable funding sources, including customer deposits;
longer-dated wholesale funding (with a remaining term exceeding one year); and equity.
Funding plans prepared Considerations in preparing funding plans
• 3 year strategic plan prepared annually • customer balance sheet growth
• annual funding plan as part of the ANZBGL Group’s • changes in wholesale funding including: targeted funding volumes; markets;

RBA Term Funding Facility
As an additional source of funding, in March 2020, the RBA announced a Term Funding Facility (TFF) for the banking system to support lending to
Australian businesses. The TFF is a three-year secured funding facility to ADIs at a fixed rate of 0.25% for drawdowns up to 4 November 2020, and
reduced to 0.10% for new drawdowns from 4 November 2020 onwards. The TFF was closed to drawdowns on 30 June 2021.
As at 30 September 2023, $8.1 billion remains drawn under the RBA’s TFF (2022: $20.1 billion).
RBNZ Funding for Lending Programme and Term Lending Facility
Between May 2020 and July 2021, the RBNZ made funds available under a Term Lending Facility (TLF) to promote lending to businesses. The TLF is a
five-year secured funding facility for New Zealand banks at a fixed rate of 0.25%.
In November 2020 the RBNZ announced a Funding for Lending Programme (FLP) which aimed to lower the cost of borrowing for New Zealand
businesses and households. The FLP is a three-year secured funding facility for New Zealand banks at a floating rate of the New Zealand Official Cash
Rate (OCR). New Zealand banks were able to obtain initial funding of up to 4% of their lending to New Zealand resident households, non-financial
businesses and non-profit institutions serving households as at 31 October 2020 (eligible loans). The initial allocation closed on 6 June 2022. An
additional allocation of up to 2% of eligible loans was available, subject to certain conditions until 6 December 2022.
As at 30 September 2023, ANZ Bank New Zealand had drawn $0.3 billion under the TLF (2022: $0.3 billion) and $3.2 billion under the FLP (2022: $2.3
billion).

CLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
The Group recognises and measures financial instruments at either fair value or amortised cost, with a significant number of financial instruments on
the balance sheet at fair value.
Fair value is the best estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date.

Overview
environment overview report report report information NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
19. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (continued)
FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE
The fair valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities is generally determined at the individual instrument level.
If the Group holds offsetting risk positions, then we use the portfolio exception in AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement (AASB 13) to measure the fair value
of such groups of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Group measure the portfolio based on the price that would be received to sell a net long
position (an asset) for a particular risk exposure, or to transfer a net short position (a liability) for a particular risk exposure.
Fair value designation
The Group designate certain loans and advances and certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or loss:
• where they contain a separable embedded derivative which significantly modifies the instruments’ cash flow ensuring we recognise the fair value
movements on the assets or liabilities in profit or loss in the same period as the movement on the associated hedging instruments; or
• in order to eliminate an accounting mismatch which would arise if the asset or liabilities were otherwise carried at amortised cost. This mismatch
arises due to measuring the derivative financial instruments (which we use to mitigate interest rate risk of these assets or liabilities) at fair value
through profit or loss.
Our approach ensures that we recognise the fair value movements on the assets or liabilities in profit or loss in the same period as the movement on
the associated derivatives.
The Group may also designate certain loans and advances, certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or
loss where they are managed on a fair value basis to align the measurement with how the instruments are managed.
FAIR VALUE APPROACH AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES
We use valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities for recognition, measurement and disclosure purposes where no quoted
price in an active market exists for that asset or liability. This includes the following:
Asset or Liability Fair Value Approach
Financial instruments classified as: Discounted cash flow techniques are used whereby contractual future cash flows of
- Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities the instrument are discounted using wholesale market interest rates, or market
(including trading and non-trading) borrowing rates for debt or loans with similar maturities or yield curve appropriate for
the remaining term to maturity.
- Repurchase agreements < 90 days
- Net loans and advances
- Deposits and other borrowings
- Debt issuances
Other financial instruments held for trading: Valuation techniques are used that incorporate observable market inputs for financial
- Securities sold short instruments with similar credit risk, maturity and yield characteristics.
- Debt and equity securities Equity securities where an active market does not exist are measured using
comparable company valuation multiples (such as price-to-book ratios).
Financial instruments classified as: Valuation techniques use comparable multiples (such as price-to-book ratios) or
- Investment securities – debt or equity discounted cashflow (DCF) techniques incorporating, to the extent possible,
observable inputs from instruments with similar characteristics.
There were no significant changes to valuation approaches during the current or prior periods.

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY
The Group categorises assets and liabilities carried at fair value into a fair value hierarchy in accordance with AASB 13 based on the observability of
inputs used to measure the fair value:
• Level 1 - valuations based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2 - valuations using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for a similar asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly; and
• Level 3 - valuations where significant unobservable inputs are used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability.
The following table presents assets and liabilities carried at fair value in accordance with the fair value hierarchy:

19. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (continued)
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT INCORPORATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET DATA
Level 3 fair value measurements
Level 3 financial instruments are a net asset of $2,128 million (2022: $1,802 million) for the Group. The assets and liabilities which incorporate
significant unobservable inputs are:
• equity and debt securities for which there is no active market or traded prices cannot be observed;
• loans and advances measured at fair value for which there is no observable market data; and
• derivatives referencing market rates that cannot be observed primarily due to lack of market activity.
Level 3 Transfers
During the year, the Group transferred $218 million (2022: $312 million) of Loan and advances measured at fair value from Level 2 to Level 3, as a result
of valuation parameters becoming unobservable during the year. There were no other material transfers into or out of Level 3 during the period.
The material Level 3 financial instruments as at 30 September 2023 are listed as below:
i) Investment Securities - equity holdings classified as FVOCI
Bank of Tianjin (BoT)
The Group holds an investment in the Bank of Tianjin. The investment is valued based on comparative price-to-book (P/B) multiples (a P/B multiple is
the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of equity). The extent of judgement applied in determining the appropriate multiple and
comparator group from which the multiple is derived resulted in the Level 3 classification. As at September 2023, the BoT equity holding balance was
$849 million (2022: $854 million). The decrease in the BoT fair valuation was due to a decrease in the P/B multiple used in the valuation.
Other equity investments
The Group holds $535 million (2022: $491 million) of unlisted equities classified as FVOCI, for which there are no active markets or traded prices
available, resulting in a Level 3 classification. The increase in unlisted equity holdings balance was mainly due to new investments made, partially
offset by a net revaluation decrease to other unlisted equity instruments.
ii) Net loans and advances - classified as FVTPL
Syndication Loans
The Group holds $729 million (2022: $403 million) of syndication loans for sale which are measured at FVTPL for which there is no observable market
data available for the valuation. The increase in the Level 3 loan balances was mainly due to increased syndication loans for sale at reporting date, and
loans and advances transferred from Level 2 to Level 3.
Sensitivity to Level 3 data inputs
When we make assumptions due to significant inputs to a valuation not being directly observable (Level 3 inputs), then changing these assumptions
changes the Group’s estimate of the instrument’s fair value. Favourable and unfavourable changes are determined by changing the primary
unobservable parameters used to derive the fair valuation.
Investment Securities - equity holdings
The valuations of the equity investments are sensitive to variations in select unobservable inputs, with valuation techniques used including P/B
multiples and discounted cashflow techniques. If for example, a 10% increase or decrease to the primary input into the valuations were to occur (such
as the P/B multiple), it would result in a $138 million increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio, which would be recognised in shareholders’
equity in the Group, with no impact to net profit or loss.
Net Loans and Advances
Syndicated loan valuations are sensitive to credit spreads in determining their fair valuation. However as these are primarily investment-grade loans,
an increase or decrease in credit spreads and/or interest yield would have an immaterial impact on net profit or net assets of the Group.
Other
The remaining Level 3 balance is immaterial and changes in inputs have a minimal impact on net profit and net assets of the Group.
Deferred fair value gains and losses
Where fair values are determined using unobservable inputs significant to the fair value of a financial instrument, the Group does not immediately
recognise the difference between the transaction price and the amount we determine based on the valuation technique (day one gain or loss) in
profit or loss. After initial recognition, we recognise the deferred amount in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the life of the transaction or until
all inputs become observable. Day one gains and losses which have been deferred are not material.

19. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (continued)
FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE (continued)
The following table sets out the Group’s basis of estimating the fair values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost where the carrying
value is not typically a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Financial Asset and Liability Fair Value Approach
Investment securities - debt securities at amortised cost Calculated based on quoted market prices or observable inputs as applicable. If
quoted market prices are not available, we use a discounted cash flow model using a
yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity of the debt instrument.
The fair value reflects adjustments to credit spreads applicable for that instrument.
Net loans and advances to banks Discounted cash flows using prevailing market rates for loans with similar
credit quality.
Net loans and advances to customers Present value of future cash flows, discounted using a curve that incorporates
changes in wholesale market rates, the Group’s cost of wholesale funding and the
customer margin, as appropriate.
Deposit liability without a specified maturity or at call The amount payable on demand at the reporting date. We do not adjust the fair
value for any value we expect the Group to derive from retaining the deposit for a
future period.
Interest bearing fixed maturity deposits and other Market borrowing rates of interest for debt with a similar maturity are used to
borrowings and acceptances with quoted market rates discount contractual cash flows to derive the fair value.
Debt issuances Calculated based on quoted market prices or observable inputs as applicable. If
quoted market prices are not available, we use a discounted cash flow model using a
yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity of the debt instrument.
The fair value reflects adjustments to credit spreads applicable to ANZ for that
instrument.
KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
A significant portion of financial instruments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The Group therefore regularly evaluates the key
valuation assumptions used in the determination of the fair valuation of financial instruments incorporated within the financial statements,
as this can involve a high degree of judgement and estimation in determining the carrying values at the balance date.
In determining the fair valuation of financial instruments, the Group has considered the impact of related economic and market conditions
on fair value measurement assumptions and the appropriateness of valuation inputs in these estimates, notably valuation adjustments, as
well as the impact of these matters on the classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy.
Most of the valuation models the Group uses employ only observable market data as inputs. For certain financial instruments, we may use
data that is not readily observable in current markets. If we use unobservable market data, then we need to exercise more judgement to
determine fair value depending on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. Generally, we derive unobservable
inputs from other relevant market data and compare them to observed transaction prices where available. When establishing the fair value
of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group also considers any required valuation adjustments in determining the fair
value. We may apply adjustments (such as credit valuation adjustments and funding valuation adjustments – refer to Note 11 Derivative
Financial Instruments) to reflect the Group’s assessment of factors that market participants would consider in determining fair value of a
particular financial instrument.

21. OFFSETTING
We offset financial assets and financial liabilities on the balance sheet (in accordance with AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Presentation) when there is:
• a current legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts in all circumstances; and
• an intention to settle the asset and liability on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The following table identifies financial assets and financial liabilities which have not been offset but are subject to enforceable master netting
agreements (or similar arrangements) and the related amounts not offset in the balance sheet. We have not taken into account the effect of over-
collateralisation.

IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR CASH GENERATING UNITS CONTAINING GOODWILL
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is tested for impairment annually and whenever there are indicators of potential impairment. Goodwill is
allocated at the date of acquisition to the cash generating unit (CGU) or group of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the related
business combination.
Goodwill is considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. We estimate the recoverable
amount of each CGU to which goodwill is allocated using a fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCOD) approach, with a value-in-use (VIU) assessment
performed where the FVLCOD is less than the carrying amount.
Goodwill is allocated to the following CGUs based on the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored.

We estimate the FVLCOD of each CGU to which goodwill is allocated by applying observable price earnings multiples of comparable companies to
the estimated future maintainable earnings of each CGU. A deduction is then made for estimated costs of disposal. The valuation is considered to be
level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to unobservable inputs used in the valuation.
Management’s approach and the key assumptions used in determining FVLCOD are as follows:
Key assumption Approach to determining the value (or values) for each key assumption
Future maintainable earnings Future maintainable earnings for each CGU is estimated as the sum of:
• The Group’s 2024 financial plan for each CGU; and
• An allocation of the central costs recorded outside of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.
Where relevant, adjustments are made to the Group’s financial plan to reflect the long-term expectations for
items such as expected credit losses and investment spend.
Price/Earnings (P/E) multiple P/E multiples applicable to each CGU have been derived from a comparator group of publicly traded
companies, and include a 30% control premium, discussed below.
In the case of the New Zealand and Institutional CGUs, management has made downwards adjustments to
P/E multiples to address specific factors relevant to those CGUs.
A control premium has been applied which recognises the increased consideration a potential acquirer
would be willing to pay in order to gain sufficient ownership to achieve control over the relevant activities of
the CGU. For each CGU, the control premium has been estimated as 30% of the comparator group P/E
multiple based on historical transactions.
Costs of disposal Costs of disposal have been estimated as 2% of the fair value of the CGU based on those observed from
historical and recent transactions.
As noted above, our impairment testing did not result in the identification of any material impairment of goodwill as at 30 September 2023.
The FVLCOD estimates for each CGU are sensitive to assumptions about P/E multiples, future maintainable earnings and control premium (30%).
However, each CGU would continue to show a surplus in recoverable amount over carrying amount even where other reasonably possible alternative
estimates were used.

22. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)
KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
Management judgement is used to assess the recoverable value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the useful economic life of an
asset, or whether an asset has an indefinite life. We reassess the recoverability of the carrying value at each reporting date.
Goodwill
A number of key judgements are required in the determination of whether or not a goodwill balance is impaired including:
• the level at which goodwill is allocated – consistent with prior periods the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated are the Group’s revenue
generating segments that benefit from relevant historical business combinations generating goodwill.
• determination of the carrying amount of each CGU which includes an allocation, on a reasonable and consistent basis, of corporate
assets and liabilities that are not directly attributable to the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.
• assessment of the recoverable amount of each CGU including:
o selection of the model used to determine the fair value – the Group has used the market multiple approach to estimate the fair
value; and
o selection of the key assumptions in respect of future maintainable earnings, the P/E multiple applied, including selection of an
appropriate comparator group and determination of an appropriate control premium, and costs of disposal as described above.
Software and other intangible assets
At each reporting date, software and other intangible assets are assessed for indicators of impairment and, where such indicators are
identified, an impairment assessment is performed. In the event that an asset’s carrying amount is determined to be greater than its
recoverable amount, the carrying amount of the asset is written down immediately. Those assets not yet ready for use are tested for
impairment annually.
In addition, the expected useful lives of intangible assets are assessed at each reporting date. The assessment requires management
judgement, and in relation to our software assets, a number of factors can influence the expected useful lives. These factors include
changes to business strategy, significant divestments and the pace of technological change.

23. OTHER PROVISIONS (continued)
Customer remediation
Customer remediation includes provisions for expected refunds to customers, remediation project costs and related customer and regulatory claims,
penalties and litigation costs and outcomes.
Restructuring costs
Provisions for restructuring costs arise from activities related to material changes in the scope of business undertaken by the Group or the manner in
which that business is undertaken and include employee termination benefits. Costs relating to on-going activities are not provided for and are
expensed as incurred.
Non-lending losses, frauds and forgeries
Non-lending losses include losses arising from certain legal actions not directly related to amounts of principal outstanding for loans and advances
and losses arising from forgeries, frauds and the correction of operational issues. The amounts recognised are the best estimate of the consideration
required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties that surround the events and
circumstances that affect the provision.
Other
Other provisions comprise various other provisions including workers compensation, make-good provisions associated with leased premises,
warranties and indemnities provided in connection with various disposals of businesses and assets, and contingent liabilities recognised as part of a
business combination.
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
The Group recognises provisions when there is a present obligation arising from a past event, an outflow of economic resources is
probable, and the amount of the provision can be measured reliably.
The amount recognised is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into
account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the timing and amount of the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the
estimated cash flows required to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The Group holds provisions for various obligations including customer remediation, restructuring costs, non-lending losses, frauds and
forgeries and litigation related claims. These provisions involve judgements regarding the timing and outcome of future events, including
estimates of expenditure required to satisfy such obligations. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in light of such
advice, provisions and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made.
In relation to customer remediation, determining the amount of the provisions, which represent management’s best estimate of the cost
of settling the identified matters, requires the exercise of significant judgement. It will often be necessary to form a view on a number of
different assumptions, including the number of impacted customers, the average refund per customer, the associated remediation project
costs, and the implications of regulatory exposures and customer claims having regard to their specific facts and circumstances. There is a
heightened level of estimation uncertainty where the customer remediation provision relates to a legal proceeding or matter. The
appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence
including expert legal advice, and adjustments are made to the provisions where appropriate.

ANZ Bank New Zealand Preference Shares
ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited (ANZ Bank New Zealand), a member of the Group, issued $484 million (NZD 550 million) of Perpetual Preference
Shares (PPS) on 18 July 2022. These are considered non-controlling interests of the Group.
The key terms of the PPS are as follows:
PPS dividends
PPS dividends are payable at the discretion of the Directors of ANZ Bank New Zealand and are non-cumulative. ANZ Bank New Zealand must not
authorise or pay a dividend on its ordinary shares, acquire its ordinary shares or otherwise undertake a capital reduction in respect of its ordinary
shares until the next PPS dividend payment date if a PPS dividend is not paid.
Should ANZ Bank New Zealand elect to pay a PPS dividend, the PPS dividend is 6.95% per annum until 18 July 2028, and a floating rate equal to the
aggregate of the New Zealand 3 month bank bill rate plus 3.25%, multiplied by one minus the New Zealand company tax rate (where the PPS
dividend is fully imputed) thereafter, with PPS dividend payments scheduled to be paid on 18 January, 18 April, 18 July and 18 October each year.

24. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY (continued)
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
Ordinary shares Ordinary shares have no par value. They entitle holders to receive dividends, or proceeds
available on winding up of the Company, in proportion to the number of fully paid ordinary
shares held. They are recognised at the amount paid per ordinary share net of directly
attributable costs. Every holder of fully paid ordinary shares present at a meeting of the
Company in person, or by proxy, is entitled to:
• on a show of hands, one vote; and
• on a poll, one vote, for each share held.
Treasury shares Treasury shares are shares in the Company which:
• the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan purchases on market and have not yet
distributed, or
• the Company issues to the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan and have not yet been
distributed.
Treasury shares are deducted from share capital and excluded from the weighted average
number of ordinary shares used in the earnings per share calculations.
Reserves:
Foreign currency translation reserve Includes differences arising on translation of assets and liabilities into Australian dollars when
the functional currency of a foreign operation (including subsidiaries and branches) is not
Australian dollars. In this reserve, we reflect any offsetting gains or losses on hedging these
exposures, together with any tax effect.
Cash flow hedge reserve Includes fair value gains and losses associated with the effective portion of designated cash
flow hedging instruments together with any tax effect.
FVOCI reserve Includes changes in the fair value of certain debt securities and equity securities included
within Investment Securities together with any tax effect.
In respect of debt securities classified as measured at FVOCI, the FVOCI reserve records
accumulated changes in fair value arising subsequent to initial recognition, except for those
relating to allowance for expected credit losses, interest income and foreign currency
exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. As debt securities at FVOCI
are recorded at fair value, the balance of the FVOCI reserve is net of the ECL allowance
associated with such assets. When a debt security measured at FVOCI is derecognised, the
cumulative gain or loss recognised in the FVOCI reserve in respect of that security is
reclassified to profit or loss and presented in other operating income.
In respect of the equity securities classified as measured at FVOCI, the FVOCI reserve records
accumulated changes in fair value arising subsequent to initial recognition (including any
related foreign exchange gains or losses). When an equity security measured at FVOCI is
derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in the FVOCI reserve in respect of that
security is not recycled to profit or loss.
Share option reserve Includes amounts which arise on the recognition of share-based compensation expense.
Transactions with non-controlling Includes the impact of transactions with non-controlling shareholders in their capacity as
interests reserve shareholders.
Non-controlling interests Share in the net assets of controlled entities attributable to equity interests which the Group
does not own directly or indirectly.

25. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
ANZ’s capital management framework includes managing capital at Level 1, Level 2 and ANZGHL Group.
ANZ’s framework includes managing to Board approved risk appetite settings and maintaining all regulatory requirements. APRA requirements at
Level 1 and Level 2 include ANZ operating at or above APRAs expectation for Domestic Systematically Important Banks (D-SIBs) following the
implementation of APRA’s Capital Reform which was effective January 2023.
APRA’s authority for ANZGHL to be a non-operating holding company (NOHC) of an ADI includes five conditions for ANZ’s capital management
framework. Two of these are quantitative requirements being:
• ANZGHL must always ensure that the quality and quantity of the total capital of the Level 3 group is equivalent to, or greater than, the quality and
quantity of the sum of the total capital of the consolidated ANZ Bank Group and the consolidated ANZ Non-Bank Group.
• ANZGHL must calculate and manage capital for the ANZ Non-Bank Group in accordance with an Economic Capital Model (ECM), which requires
the amount of capital held, in the form of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), to be equal to or greater than the capital requirement as calculated under
the ECM.
ANZ has implemented an ECM to calculate the capital to support the ANZ Non-Bank Group operations. The material risks included in the Non-Bank
Group currently are investment risk and fixed asset risk.
All requirements were satisfied as at 30 September 2023.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
ANZ’s capital management strategy aims to protect the interests of depositors, creditors and shareholders. We achieve this through an Internal
Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) whereby ANZ conducts detailed strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon.
The process involves:
• forecasting economic variables, financial performance of ANZ’s divisions and the financial impact of new strategic initiatives to be implemented
during the planning period;
• performing stress tests under different economic scenarios to determine the level of additional capital (stress capital buffer) needed to absorb
losses that may be experienced under an economic downturn;
• reviewing capital position and targets against ANZ’s risk profile; and
• developing a capital plan, taking into account capital ratio targets, ECM requirements, current and future capital issuances requirements and
options around capital products, timing and markets to execute the capital plan under differing market and economic conditions.
The capital plan is approved by the Board and updated as required. The Board and senior management are provided with regular updates of ANZ’s
capital position. Any material actions required to ensure ongoing prudent capital management are submitted to the Board for approval. Throughout
the year, the Group maintained compliance with all the regulatory requirements related to Capital Adequacy in the jurisdictions in which it operates.

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
Australia
As the ANZ Bank Group is an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) in Australia, it is primarily regulated by APRA under the Banking Act 1959
(Cth). ANZ Bank Group must comply with the minimum regulatory capital requirements, prudential capital ratios and specific reporting levels that
APRA sets and which are consistent with the global Basel III capital framework. This is the common framework for determining the appropriate level of
bank regulatory capital as set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. APRA minimum requirements are summarised below:
Regulatory Capital Definition
Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital Tier 1 Capital Tier 2 Capital Total Capital
Shareholders’ equity adjusted for CET1 Capital plus certain Subordinated debt instruments Tier 1 plus Tier 2 Capital.

weighted assets must be at least 4.5%. weighted assets must be at least weighted assets must be at least

must be of at least 11% from 1st Jan
2024. Refer below for details.
Reporting Levels

The ADI on a stand-alone basis (that is The consolidated ANZBGL Group A conglomerate ANZGHL Group at the widest level.
ANZBGL and specified subsidiaries less certain subsidiaries and
which are consolidated to form the associates that are excluded
ADI’s Extended Licensed Entity). under prudential standards.
As at 30 September 2023, APRA also requires the ADI to hold additional CET1 buffers as follows:
• a capital conservation buffer (CCB) of 4.75% which is inclusive of the additional 1% surcharge for domestically systemically important banks (D-SIBs).
APRA has determined that ANZ is a D-SIB.
• a countercyclical capital buffer which is set on a jurisdictional basis. The requirement is currently set at 1% for Australia.
Additionally in December 2021, APRA announced that it requires all D-SIBs including ANZ to increase its minimum total capital ratio requirement by
3% of RWA by January 2024, and a further 1.5% of RWA by January 2026 (total increase of 4.5%). APRA expects this to be predominantly met by Tier 2
Capital, with an equivalent decrease in other senior funding. ANZ is on track to meet these requirements as at reporting date.
ANZ reports to APRA on a Level 1 and Level 2 basis, and measures capital adequacy monthly on a Level 1 and Level 2 basis, and is not yet required to
maintain capital on a Level 3 basis (APRA have yet to conclude required timing for Level 3 reporting).
Insurance and Funds Management
As required by APRA’s Prudential Standards, insurance and funds management activities are:
• de-consolidated for the purposes of calculating capital adequacy; and
• excluded from the risk-based capital adequacy framework.
We deduct the investment in these controlled entities 100% from CET1 capital, and if we include any profits from these activities in the ANZ Bank
Group’s results, then we exclude them from the determination of CET1 capital to the extent they have not been remitted.
Outside Australia
In addition to APRA, ANZ’s branch operations and major banking subsidiary operations are also overseen by local regulators such as the Reserve Bank
of New Zealand, the US Federal Reserve, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. They may impose minimum capital levels on operations in their individual
jurisdictions.

25. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (continued)
APRA Capital Reform
APRA released new bank capital adequacy requirements applying to Australian incorporated registered banks, which are set out in APRA’s Banking
Prudential Standard documents. ANZ implemented these new requirements from January 2023.
The new capital adequacy key requirements include changes to APS 110 Capital Adequacy (APS 110), APS 112 Capital Adequacy: Standardised
Approach to Credit Risk (APS 112) and APS 113 Capital Adequacy: Internal Ratings-based Approach to Credit Risk (APS 113) with key features of the
reforms including:
• improving the flexibility of the capital framework, through larger capital buffers that can be used by banks to support lending during periods of
stress;
• changes to risk weighted assets (RWA) through more risk-sensitive risk weights increasing capital requirements for higher risk lending and
decreasing it for lower risks;
• changes to loss given default rates (LGD) including approved use of an internal ratings-based (IRB) approved LGD model for mortgage portfolios;
• an increase in the IRB scaling factor (from 1.06x to 1.1x);
• requirement that IRB ADIs calculate and disclose RWA under the standardised approach and the introduction of a capital floor at 72.5% of
standardised RWA; and
• use of prescribed New Zealand authority’s equivalent prudential rules for the purpose of calculating the Level 2 regulatory capital requirement.
In addition, operational RWA is now calculated under APS 115 Capital Adequacy: Standardised Measurement Approach to Operational Risk (APS 115)
which replaced the previous advanced methodology from December 2022.
The application of APRA Capital Reform reduced RWA by $34.5 billion, equivalent to a 100 bps CET1 ratio benefit. This was partially offset by APRA’s
expectations that ADIs operate a higher capital ratio to maintain an unquestionably strong level.
ANZ’s compliance with the quantitative conditions for capital management under the APRA NOHC authority is presented in the following two tables1:

27. CONTROLLED ENTITIES (continued)
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
The Group’s subsidiaries are those entities it controls through:
• being exposed to, or having rights to, variable returns from the entity; and
• being able to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The Group assesses whether it has power over those entities by examining the Group’s existing rights to direct the relevant activities of the
entity.
If the Group sells or acquires subsidiaries during the year, it includes their operating results in the Group results to the date of disposal or
from the date of acquisition. When the Group’s control ceases, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any related non-
controlling interest and other components of equity.
If the Group’s ownership interest in a subsidiary changes in a way that does not result in a loss of control, then the Group accounts for that
as a transaction with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders.
All transactions between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.

28. INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES (continued)
IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT
The Group assesses the carrying value of its associates investments for impairment indicators.
At 30 September 2023, the impairment assessment of non-lending assets identified that one of the Group’s associated investments PT Panin had
indicators of impairment. No impairment was recognised as its carrying value is supported by its VIU calculations.
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence over its operating and financial policies but does not control. The
Group accounts for associates using the equity method. Its investments in associates are carried at cost plus the post-acquisition share of
changes in the associate’s net assets less accumulated impairments. Dividends the Group receives from associates are recognised as a
reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. The Group includes goodwill recognised by the associate in the carrying amount of
the investment. It does not individually test the goodwill incorporated in the associates carrying amount for impairment.
At least at each reporting date, the Group reviews investments in associates for any indication of impairment. If an indication of impairment
exists, then the Group determines the recoverable amount of the associate using the higher of:
• the associate’s fair value less cost of disposal; and
• its value-in-use.
We use a discounted cash flow methodology, and when applicable, other methodologies (such as capitalisation of earnings methodology),
to determine the recoverable amount when determining a VIU.
KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
Investments in associates and joint ventures are assessed at each reporting date and tested for impairment when there is an indication that
the investment may be impaired. In addition, the Group is required to assess at each reporting date whether the recoverable amount of
the Group’s investment has increased to such a level as to support the reversal of prior period impairments.
Significant management judgment is required to determine the key assumptions underpinning the VIU calculation. Factors that may
change in subsequent periods and lead to potential future impairments include lower than forecast earnings levels in the near term and/or
a decrease in the long term growth forecasts, increases to required levels of regulatory capital and an increase in the post-tax discount rate
arising from an increase in the risk premium or risk-free rates.
The key assumptions used in the VIU calculation are outlined below:
As at 30 September 2023 PT Panin
Post-tax discount rate 12.2%
Terminal growth rate 5.0%
Expected earnings growth (compound annual growth rate – 5 years) 5.4%
Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (5 year average) 12.8%
The VIU calculations are sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions with reasonably possible changes in key assumptions having a
positive or negative impact on the VIU outcome, and as such the recoverable amount of the investment.
• A change in the September 2023 post-tax discount rate by +/- 50bps would impact the VIU outcome for PT Panin by $(91 million)/
$105 million.
• A change in the September 2023 terminal growth rate by +/- 25bps would impact the VIU outcome for PT Panin by $55 million/
($51 million).
The investment would not be impaired if the discount rate were increased or the terminal growth rate reduced by the reasonably possible
changes above.

29. STRUCTURED ENTITIES
A Structured Entity (SE) is an entity that has been designed such that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in determining who controls
the entity. SEs are generally established with restrictions on their ongoing activities in order to achieve narrow and well defined objectives.
SEs are classified as subsidiaries and consolidated when control exists. If the Group does not control a SE, then it is not consolidated. This note
provides information on both consolidated and unconsolidated SEs.
The Group’s involvement with SEs is as follows:
Type Details
Securitisation The Group establishes SEs to securitise customer loans and advances that it has originated, in order to diversify
sources of funding for liquidity management. Securitisation programs include customer loans and advances
assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide either security for obligations payable on notes issued by the SEs
to external investors or create assets held by the Group eligible for repurchase agreements with applicable
central banks.
The Group retains control over these SEs and therefore they are consolidated. Refer to Note 30 Transfers of
Financial Assets for further details.
The Group also establishes SEs on behalf of customers to securitise their loans or receivables. The Group may
manage these securitisation vehicles or provide liquidity or other support. Additionally, the Group may acquire
interests in securitisation vehicles set up by third parties through holding securities issued by such entities. In
limited circumstances where control exists, the Group consolidates the SE.
Covered bond issuances Certain loans and advances have been assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide security for issuances of
debt securities by the Group. The Group retains control over these SEs and therefore they are consolidated. Refer
to Note 30 Transfers of Financial Assets for further details.
Structured finance The Group is involved with SEs established:
arrangements • in connection with structured lending transactions to facilitate debt syndication and/or to ring-fence
collateral; and
• to own assets that are leased to customers in structured leasing transactions.
The Group may manage the SE, hold minor amounts of the SE’s capital, or provide risk management products
(derivatives) to the SE. In most instances, the Group does not control these SEs. In limited circumstances where
control exists, the Group consolidates the SE.
Funds management activities The Group is the scheme manager for a number of Managed Investment Schemes (MIS) in New Zealand. These
MIS are financed through the issue of units to investors and the Group considers them to be SEs. The Group’s
interests in these MIS are limited to receiving fees for services or providing risk management products
(derivatives). These interests do not create significant exposures that would allow the Group to control the funds.
Therefore, these MIS are not consolidated.
CONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES
FINANCIAL OR OTHER SUPPORT PROVIDED TO CONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES
The Group provides financial support to consolidated SEs as outlined below.
Securitisation and covered The Group provides lending facilities, derivatives and commitments to these SEs and/or holds debt instruments
bond issuances they have issued.
Structured finance The assets held by these SEs are normally pledged as collateral for financing provided. Certain consolidated SEs
arrangements are financed entirely by the Group while others are financed by syndicated loan facilities in which the Group is a
participant. The financing provided by the Group includes lending facilities where the Group’s exposure is limited
to the amount of the loan and any undrawn amount. Additionally, the Group has provided Letters of Support to
these consolidated SEs confirming that the Group will not demand repayment of the financing provided for the
ensuing 12 month period.
The Group did not provide any non-contractual support to consolidated SEs during the year (2022: nil). Other than as disclosed above, the Group does
not have any current intention to provide financial or other support to consolidated SEs.

29. STRUCTURED ENTITIES (continued)
UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES
GROUP’S INTEREST IN UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES
An ‘interest’ in an unconsolidated SE is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement with a SE that exposes the Group to variability of
returns from the performance of that SE. These interests include, but are not limited to: holdings of debt or equity securities; derivatives that pass-on
risks specific to the performance of the SE, lending, loan commitments, financial guarantees, and fees from funds management activities.
For the purpose of disclosing interests in unconsolidated SEs:
• no disclosure is made if the Group’s involvement is not more than a passive interest - for example: when the Group’s involvement constitutes a
typical customer-supplier relationship. On this basis, exposures to unconsolidated SEs that arise from lending, trading and investing activities are
not considered disclosable interests - unless the design of the structured entity allows the Group to participate in decisions about the relevant
activities (being those that significantly affect the entity’s returns).
• ‘interests’ do not include derivatives intended to expose the Group to market-risk (rather than performance risk specific to the SE) or derivatives
through which the Group creates, rather than absorbs, variability of the unconsolidated SE (such as purchase of credit protection under a credit
default swap).
The table below sets out the Group’s interests in unconsolidated SEs together with the maximum exposure to loss that could arise from
those interests:
Securitisation Structured finance Total
2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022

Maximum exposure to loss 15,757 14,913 24 43 15,781 14,956
In addition to the interests above, the Group earned funds management fees from unconsolidated investment funds of $177 million
(2022: $181 million) during the year.
The Group’s maximum exposure to loss represents the maximum amount of loss that the Group could incur as a result of its involvement with
unconsolidated SEs if loss events were to take place - regardless of the probability of occurrence. This does not in any way represent the actual losses
expected to be incurred. Furthermore, the maximum exposure to loss is stated gross of the effects of hedging and collateral arrangements entered
into to mitigate ANZ’s exposure to loss.
The maximum exposure to loss has been determined as:
• the carrying amount of Investment securities measured at amortised cost, and
• the carrying amount plus the undrawn amount of any committed loans and advances.
The size of unconsolidated SEs is indicated by total assets which vary by SE with the largest single SE having a value of approximately $4.3 billion.
The Group did not provide any non-contractual support to unconsolidated SEs during the year (2022: nil) nor does it have any current intention to
provide financial or other support to unconsolidated SEs.

SPONSORED UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES
The Group may also sponsor unconsolidated SEs in which it has no disclosable interest.
For the purposes of this disclosure, the Group considers itself the ‘sponsor’ of an unconsolidated SE if it is the primary party involved in the design and
establishment of that SE and:
• the Group is the major user of that SE; or
• the Group’s name appears in the name of that SE, or on its products; or
• the Group provides implicit or explicit guarantees of that SE’s performance.
The Group has sponsored the ANZ PIE Fund in New Zealand, which invests only in deposits with ANZ Bank New Zealand. The Group does not provide
any implicit or explicit guarantees of the capital value or performance of investments in the ANZ PIE Fund. There was no income received from, nor
assets transferred to, this entity during the year.
KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
Significant judgement is required in assessing whether the Group has control over Structured Entities. Judgement is required to determine
the existence of:
• power over the relevant activities (being those that significantly affect the entity’s returns); and
• exposure to variable returns of the entity.

30. TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
In the normal course of business the Group enters into transactions where it transfers financial assets directly to third parties or to SEs. These transfers
may result in the Group fully, or partially, derecognising those financial assets - depending on the Group’s exposure to the risks and rewards or control
over the transferred assets. If the Group retains substantially all of the risk and rewards of a transferred asset, the transfer does not qualify for
derecognition and the asset remains on the Group’s balance sheet in its entirety.
SECURITISATIONS
Net loans and advances include residential mortgages securitised under the Group’s securitisation programs which are assigned to bankruptcy
remote SEs to provide security for obligations payable on the notes issued by the SEs. The holders of the issued notes have full recourse to the pool of
residential mortgages which have been securitised and the Group cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets.
In some instances, the Group is also the holder of the securitised notes issued by the SEs. In addition, the Group is entitled to any residual income of
the SEs and sometimes enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Group retains the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to
recognise the mortgages as financial assets.
The Group is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with these securitisation SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its
power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Group.
COVERED BONDS
The Group operates various global covered bond programs to raise funding in its primary markets. Net loans and advances include residential
mortgages assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs associated with these covered bond programs. In respect of each program, a covered bond guarantor
has guaranteed payments of interest and principal pursuant to a guarantee which is secured over its assets, including these residential mortgages.
Substantially all of the assets of each covered bond guarantor consist of that covered bond guarantor’s equitable interests in mortgage loans secured
by residential real estate.
The covered bond holders have dual recourse to the issuer and the cover pool of assets. The issuer cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the
transferred assets, however, subject to legal arrangements it may repurchase and substitute assets as long as the required cover is maintained.
The Group is required to maintain the cover pool at a level sufficient to cover the bond obligations. In addition, the Group is entitled to any residual
income of the covered bond SEs (after all payments to the covered bond holders and external parties) and enters into derivatives with the SEs. The
Group retains the majority of the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets.
The Group is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with the covered bond SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power
over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Group. The covered bonds issued externally are included within debt issuances.
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS
When the Group sells securities subject to repurchase agreements under which we retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, then
those assets do not qualify for derecognition. An associated liability is recognised for the consideration received from the counterparty.
STRUCTURED FINANCE ARRANGEMENTS
The Group arranges funding for certain customer transactions through structured leasing. These transactions are recognised on Group’s balance sheet
as lease receivables or loans. At times, other financial institutions participate in the funding of these arrangements. This participation involves a
proportionate transfer of the rights to the assets recognised by the Group. The participating banks have limited recourse to the leased assets and
related proceeds. Where the Group continues to be exposed to some of the risks of the transferred assets through a derivative or other continuing
involvement, the Group does not derecognise the lease receivable or loan. Instead, the Group recognises an associated liability representing its
obligations to the participating financial institutions.
The tables below set out the balance of assets transferred that do not qualify for derecognition, along with the associated liabilities.

benefit obligation (years)
As at the most recent reporting dates of the schemes, the aggregate surplus of net market value of assets over the value of accrued benefits on a
funding basis was $53 million (2022: $69 million surplus). In 2023, the Group made defined benefit contributions totalling $2 million
(2022: $2 million). It expects to make contributions of approximately $2 million next financial year.
GOVERNANCE OF THE SCHEMES AND FUNDING OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT SECTIONS
The main defined benefit superannuation schemes in which the Group participates operate under trust law and are managed and administered on
behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the relevant trust deed and rules and all relevant legislation. These schemes have corporate
trustees, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group. The trustees are the legal owners of the assets, which are held separately from the assets
of the Group, and are responsible for setting investment policy and agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the triennial actuarial
valuation process.
The Group has defined benefit arrangements in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Philippines, Taiwan and United Kingdom. The defined benefit section
of the ANZ Australian Staff Superannuation Scheme, the ANZ UK Staff Pension Scheme and the ANZ National Retirement Scheme in New Zealand are
the three largest plans. They have been closed to new members since 1987, 2004 and 1991 respectively. None of the schemes had a material deficit,
or surplus, at the last funding valuation. The Group has no present liability under any of the schemes’ trust deeds to fund a deficit (measured on a
funding basis). A contingent liability of the Group may arise if any of the schemes were wound up.
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
Defined benefit superannuation schemes
The Group operates a small number of defined benefit schemes. Independent actuaries calculate the liability and expenses related to
providing benefits to employees under each defined benefit scheme. They use the Projected Unit Credit Method to value the liabilities. The
balance sheet includes:
• a defined benefit liability if the obligation is greater than the fair value of the schemes assets; and
• an asset (capped to its recoverable amount) if the fair value of the assets is greater than the obligation.
In each reporting period, the movements in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as follows:
• the net movement relating to the current period’s service cost, net interest on the defined benefit liability, past service costs and other
costs (such as the effects of any curtailments and settlements) as operating expenses;
• remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (which comprise actuarial gains and losses and return on scheme assets, excluding
interest income included in net interest) directly in retained earnings through other comprehensive income; and
• contributions of the Group directly against the net defined benefit position.
Defined contribution superannuation schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes. It also contributes (according to local law, in the various countries in which
it operates) to Government and other plans that have the characteristics of defined contribution plans. The Group’s contributions to these
schemes are recognised as personnel expenses when they are incurred.

32. EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS
On 3 January 2023, ANZBGL established, by a scheme of arrangement, a non-operating holding company, ANZGHL, as the new listed parent holding
company of the ANZ Group. There is no impact to employee equity (deferred shares, deferred share rights, restricted rights and performance rights) as
a result of the Restructure.
ANZ operates a number of employee share and option schemes under the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan and the ANZ Share Option Plan
which are operated by the Company. These are Group share based payment arrangements under which shares in ANZGHL (ANZ shares) are allocated
or granted to employees of the Group.
ANZ EMPLOYEE SHARE ACQUISITION PLAN
ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan schemes that operated during 2023 and 2022 were the Deferred Share Plan and the Variable Pay to Shares (VPS)
Offer. The ANZ Incentive Plan (ANZIP) (the variable remuneration plan operating across ANZ) has Short Term Variable Remuneration or Variable
Remuneration delivered under the Deferred Share Plan or ANZ Share Option Plan for eligible employees.

ii) Exceptional circumstances
Remuneration In exceptional circumstances, we grant deferred shares to certain employees when they start with ANZ to
foregone compensate them for remuneration they have forgone from their previous employer. The vesting period generally
aligns with the remaining vesting period of the remuneration they have forgone, and therefore varies between
grants.
Retention We may grant deferred shares to high performing employees who are regarded as a significant retention risk to ANZ.

iii) Further information
Cessation Unless the Board1 decides otherwise, employees forfeit their unvested deferred shares if they resign, are terminated
on notice, or are dismissed for serious misconduct. The deferred shares may be held in trust beyond the deferral
period.
Dividends Dividends are reinvested in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
Instrument Deferred share rights may be granted instead of deferred shares in some countries as locally appropriate (see
deferred share rights section).
Expensing value (fair We expense the fair value of deferred shares on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period and we
value) recognise the expense as a share-based compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity. Deferred
shares are expensed based on the one-day VWAP at the date of grant.
2023 and 2022 grants During the 2023 year, we granted 2,244,181 deferred shares (2022: 1,971,715) with a weighted average allocation
value of $24.37 (2022: $27.52).
Downward adjustment Deferred shares remain at risk and the Board has the discretion to adjust the number of deferred shares downwards,
including to zero at any time before the vesting date (malus), and limited to select employees2, recovery post vesting
(i.e., clawback). ANZ’s downward adjustment provisions are detailed in section 7.3 of the 2023 Remuneration Report.
Board discretion was not exercised to apply malus or clawback to any deferred shares in 2023 (2022: nil).
1. References to ‘the Board’ throughout this note means the Boards of ANZGHL and ANZBGL.
2. Clawback applies to the CEO, ExCo and GGM IA (for awards granted in 2023 financial year), and to select senior employees in jurisdictions where clawback regulations apply.
Variable Pay to Shares (VPS) Offer
Eligibility, grant VPS provides employees in Australia the opportunity to receive up to $1,000 worth of ANZ shares with concessional
approach and tax treatment (where criteria are met). All ANZ shares are held by a custodian or nominee appointed by the Trustee
conditions on the Trustee’s behalf and are restricted for 3 years. During this time employees benefit from dividend payments
which are reinvested through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) and have voting entitlements. After the
restriction period has been reached the shares can sold or transferred.
Allocation value Granted based on the VWAP of ANZ shares traded on the ASX in the five trading days leading up to and including the
date of grant.
Expensing value Expensed based on the one-day VWAP at the date of grant.
(fair value)
2023 grants During the 2023 year, we granted 55,600 shares on 22 November 2022 at an issue price of $24.46 (no grants were
made in relation to the VPS Offer in the 2022 year).
Expensing of the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan
Expensing value The fair value of shares we granted during 2023 under the Deferred Share Plan and VPS Offer, measured as at the date
(fair value) of grant of the shares, is $56.5 million (2022: $52.6 million Deferred Share Plan only) based on 2,299,781 shares
(2022: 1,971,715 Deferred Share Plan only) at VWAP of $24.57 (2022: $26.69).

32. EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS (continued)
ANZ SHARE OPTION PLAN
Allocation We may grant selected employees options/rights which entitle them to acquire fully paid ordinary ANZ shares at a
fixed price at the time the options/rights vest. Voting and dividend rights will be attached to the ordinary shares
allocated on exercise of the options/rights.
Each option/right entitles the holder to one ordinary share subject to the terms and conditions imposed on grant.
Exercise price of options, determined in accordance with the rules of the plan, is generally based on the VWAP of the
shares traded on the ASX in the week leading up to and including the date of grant. For rights, the exercise price is nil.
Rules Prior to the exercise of the option/right if ANZ changes its share capital due to a bonus share issue, pro-rata new share
issue or reorganisation the following adjustments are required:
• Issue of bonus shares - When the holder exercises their option, they are also entitled to be issued the number of
bonus shares they would have been entitled to had they held the underlying shares at the time of the bonus issue;
• Pro-rata share offer - We will adjust the exercise price of the option in the manner set out in the ASX Listing Rules;
and
• Reorganisation - In respect of rights, if there is a bonus issue or reorganisation of ANZ’s share capital, then the
Board may adjust the number of rights or the number of underlying shares so that there is no advantage or
disadvantage to the holder.
Holders otherwise have no other entitlements to participate:
• in any new issue of ANZ securities before they exercise their options/rights; or
• in a share issue of a body corporate other than ANZ (such as a subsidiary).
Any portion of the award which vests may, at the Boards discretion, be satisfied by a cash equivalent payment rather
than shares.
Expensing value We expense the fair value of options/rights on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period and we recognise
(fair value) the expense as a share-based compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity. Factors considered in
determining the fair value include: the market performance conditions, share price volatility, life of the instrument,
dividend yield, and share price at grant date.
Satisfying vesting Any portion of the award of options/rights (that have met the applicable time and performance conditions) may be
satisfied by a cash equivalent payment rather than shares at Board discretion.
In financial year 2023, all deferred share rights were satisfied through a share allocation, other than 70,231 deferred
share rights (2022: 55,977) for which a cash payment was made.
There were no performance rights (PR) due to vest in financial year 2023, as a result of a change in the performance
period from three years to four years. In financial year 2022, the PR that vested (previously granted in
November/December 2018) were satisfied through a share allocation, other than 24,011 PR for which a cash payment
was made.
Cessation The provisions that apply if the employee’s employment ends are in section 10.2.3 of the 2023 Remuneration Report.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
32. EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS (continued)
As at the date of the signing of the Directors’ Report on 10 November 2023:
• no options/rights over ordinary shares have been granted since the end of 2023; and
• no shares issued as a result of the exercise of options/rights since the end of 2023.
Fair Value Assumptions
When determining the fair value, we apply the standard market techniques for valuation, including Monte Carlo and/or Black Scholes pricing models.
We do so in accordance with the requirements of AASB 2 Share-based Payments. The models take into account early exercise of vested equity, non-
transferability and internal/external performance hurdles (if any).
The table below shows the significant assumptions we used as inputs into our fair value calculation of instruments granted during the period. We
present the values as weighted averages, but the specific values we use for each allocation are the ones we use for the fair value calculation.

1. Expected volatility represents a measure of the amount by which ANZ’s share price is expected to fluctuate over the life of the rights. The measure of volatility used in the model is the annualised standard
deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the historical share price over a defined period of time preceding the date of grant. This historical average annualised volatility is then used to
estimate a reasonable expected volatility over the expected life of the rights.
SATISFYING EQUITY AWARDS
All shares underpinning equity awards may be purchased on market, reallocated or be newly issued shares, or a combination.
The equity we purchased on market during the 2023 financial year (either under the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan and the ANZ Share Option
Plan, or to satisfy options or rights) for all employees amounted to 816,023 shares at an average price of $24.35 per share (2022: 4,230,962 shares at an
average price of $27.57 per share).

Total 290,882 285,816
UNDRAWN FACILITIES
The majority of undrawn facilities are subject to customers maintaining specific credit and other requirements or conditions. Many of these facilities
are expected to be only partially used, and others may never be used at all. As such, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not necessarily
representative of future liquidity risks or future cash requirements. Based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay, the full
amount of undrawn facilities for the Group mature within 12 months.
GUARANTEES, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND PERFORMANCE RELATED CONTINGENCIES
Guarantees, letters of credit and performance related contingencies relate to transactions that the Group has entered into as principal – including
guarantees, standby letters of credit and documentary letters of credit.
Documentary letters of credit involve the Group issuing letters of credit guaranteeing payment in favour of an exporter. They are secured against an
underlying shipment of goods or backed by a confirmatory letter of credit from another bank.
Performance-related contingencies are liabilities that oblige the Group to make payments to a third party if the customer fails to fulfil its non-
monetary obligations under the contract.
To reflect the risk associated with these transactions, we apply the same credit origination, portfolio management and collateral requirements that we
apply to loans. The contract amount represents the maximum potential amount that we could lose if the counterparty fails to meet its financial
obligations. As the facilities may expire without being drawn upon, the notional amounts do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements. Based
on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay, the full amount of guarantees and letters of credit and performance-related
contingencies for the Group mature within 12 months.
OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
There are outstanding court proceedings, claims and possible claims for and against the Group. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained
and, in the light of such advice, provisions (refer to Note 23 Other Provisions) and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made. In some
instances we have not disclosed the estimated financial impact of the individual items either because it is not practicable to do so or because such
disclosure may prejudice the interests of the Group.
A description of contingent liabilities and contingent assets as at 30 September 2023 is set out below.
REGULATORY AND CUSTOMER EXPOSURES
The Group regularly engages with its regulators in relation to regulatory investigations, surveillance and reviews, reportable situations, civil
enforcement actions (whether by court action or otherwise), formal and informal inquiries and regulatory supervisory activities in Australia and
globally. The Group has received various notices and requests for information from its regulators as part of both industry-wide and Group-specific
reviews and has also made disclosures to its regulators at its own instigation. The nature of these interactions can be wide ranging and, for example,
include or have included in recent years a range of matters including responsible lending practices, regulated lending requirements, product
suitability and distribution, interest and fees and the entitlement to charge them, customer remediation, wealth advice, insurance distribution, pricing,
competition, conduct in financial markets and financial transactions, capital market transactions, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism
financing obligations, privacy obligations and information security, business continuity management, reporting and disclosure obligations and
product disclosure documentation. There may be exposures to customers which are additional to any regulatory exposures. These could include class
actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with such reviews and
possible exposures remain uncertain.

SOUTH AFRICAN RATE ACTION
In February 2017, the South African Competition Commission commenced proceedings against local and international banks including ANZBGL
alleging breaches of the cartel provisions of the South African Competition Act in respect of trading in the South African rand. The potential civil
penalty or other financial impact is uncertain.
CAPITAL RAISING ACTION
In September 2018, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) commenced civil penalty proceedings against ANZBGL alleging
failure to comply with continuous disclosure obligations in connection with ANZBGL’s August 2015 underwritten institutional share placement. In
October 2023, the Federal Court of Australia found that ANZBGL should have notified the ASX of the joint lead managers’ take-up of placement shares.
No order has yet been made in respect of payment of legal costs or the amount of a civil penalty. The maximum penalty is $1 million.
ESANDA DEALER CAR LOAN LITIGATION
In August 2020, a class action was brought against ANZBGL alleging unfair conduct, misleading or deceptive conduct and equitable mistake in
relation to the use of flex commissions in dealer arranged Esanda car loans. ANZBGL is defending the allegations.
ONEPATH SUPERANNUATION LITIGATION
In December 2020, a class action was brought against OnePath Custodians, OnePath Life and ANZBGL alleging that OnePath Custodians breached its
obligations under superannuation legislation, and its duties as trustee, in respect of superannuation investments and fees. The claim also alleges that
ANZBGL was involved in some of OnePath Custodians’ investment breaches. ANZBGL is defending the allegations.
NEW ZEALAND LOAN INFORMATION LITIGATION
In September 2021, a representative proceeding was brought against ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited, alleging breaches of disclosure requirements
under consumer credit legislation in respect of variation letters sent to certain loan customers. ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited is defending the
allegations.
CREDIT CARDS LITIGATION
In November 2021, a class action was brought against ANZBGL alleging that certain interest terms in credit card contracts were unfair contract terms
and that it was unconscionable for ANZBGL to rely on them. ANZBGL is defending the allegations.
ROYAL COMMISSION
The Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry released its final report on 4 February 2019.
Following the Royal Commission there have been, and continue to be, additional costs and further exposures, including exposures associated with
further regulator activity or potential customer exposures such as class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities.
The outcomes and total costs associated with these possible exposures remain uncertain.
SECURITY RECOVERY ACTIONS
Various claims have been made or are anticipated, arising from security recovery actions taken to resolve impaired assets. These claims will be
defended.
WARRANTIES, INDEMNITIES AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT FEES
The Group has provided warranties, indemnities and other commitments in favour of the purchaser and other persons in connection with various
disposals of businesses and assets and other transactions, covering a range of matters and risks. It is exposed to claims under those warranties,
indemnities and commitments, some of which are currently active. The outcomes and total costs associated with these exposures remain uncertain.
The Group has entered an arrangement to pay performance management fees to external fund managers in the event predetermined performance
criteria are satisfied in relation to certain Group investments. The satisfaction of the performance criteria and associated performance management fee
remains uncertain.

CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS
Certain group companies have a commitment to comply with rules governing various clearing and settlement arrangements which could result in a
credit risk exposure and loss if another member institution fails to settle its payment clearing activities. The Group’s potential exposure arising from
these arrangements is unquantifiable in advance.
Certain group companies hold memberships of central clearing houses, including ASX Clear (Futures), London Clearing House (LCH), SwapClear and
RepoClear, Korea Exchange (KRX), Hong Kong Exchange (HKEX), Clearing Corporation of India and the Shanghai Clearing House. These memberships
allow the relevant group company to centrally clear derivative instruments in line with cross-border regulatory requirements. Common to all of these
memberships is the requirement for the relevant group company to make default fund contributions. In the event of a default by another member,
the relevant group company could potentially be required to commit additional default fund contributions which are unquantifiable in advance.
PARENT ENTITY GUARANTEES
Certain group companies have issued letters of comfort and guarantees in respect of certain subsidiaries in the normal course of business. Under
these letters and guarantees, the issuing entity undertakes to ensure that those subsidiaries continue to meet their financial obligations, subject to
certain conditions including that the subsidiary remains a controlled entity.
SALE OF GRINDLAYS BUSINESS
On 31 July 2000, ANZBGL completed the sale to Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) of ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited (Grindlays) and certain other
businesses. ANZBGL provided warranties and indemnities relating to those businesses.
The indemnified matters include civil penalty proceedings and criminal prosecutions brought by Indian authorities against Grindlays and certain of its
officers, in relation to certain transactions conducted in 1991 that are alleged to have breached the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973. Civil
penalties were imposed in 2007 which are the subject of appeals. The criminal prosecutions are being defended.
CONTINGENT ASSETS
NATIONAL HOUSING BANK
ANZBGL is pursuing recovery of the proceeds of certain disputed cheques which were credited to the account of a former Grindlays customer in the
early 1990s.
The disputed cheques were drawn on the National Housing Bank (NHB) in India. Proceedings between Grindlays and NHB concerning the proceeds of
the cheques were resolved in early 2002.
Recovery is now being pursued from the estate of the Grindlays customer who received the cheque proceeds. Any amounts recovered are to be
shared between ANZBGL and NHB.

On 18 July 2022, the ANZ Group announced an agreement to purchase 100% of the shares in SBGH Limited, the immediate non-operating holding
company of Suncorp Bank. The acquisition was subject to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) authorisation or approval. The
ACCC declined to grant authorisation for this acquisition in August 2023 and this decision is currently subject to review by the Australian Competition
Tribunal. In addition, the acquisition remains subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including Federal Treasurer approval and certain
amendments to the State Financial Institutions and Metway Merger Act 1996 (QLD). ANZBGL will also have a termination right under the Suncorp
Bank Sale Agreement if APRA issues a written communication to ANZBGL under or in connection with APS 222 Associations with Related Entities to
the effect that ANZBGL must not proceed with completion of the acquisition. Assuming these conditions are satisfied, and merger approval is granted,
it is expected to occur in mid-calendar year 2024.

BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report section of our
report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and

• IT systems and controls.
Key Audit Matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Report of the current

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
KEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)
ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES ($4,408m)
Refer to the critical accounting estimates and judgements disclosures in relation to the allowance for expected credit losses in Note 14 to the Financial
Report.
The key audit matter
Allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) is a key audit matter due to the significance of the loans and advances balances to the financial statements
and the inherent complexity of the expected credit loss models (ECL models) used to measure ECL allowances. These models are reliant on data and
estimates including multiple economic scenarios and key assumptions such as defining a significant increase in credit risk (SICR).
AASB 9 Financial Instruments requires the Group to measure ECLs on a forward-looking basis reflecting a range of economic conditions. Post-model
adjustments are considered to address known ECL model limitations or emerging trends in the loan portfolios. We exercise significant judgement in
challenging the economic scenarios and the judgmental post-model adjustments.
Additional subjectivity and judgement is required due to the heightened uncertainty associated with the impact of the economic outlook and its
impact on customers, increasing our audit effort thereon.
SICR identification, such as a decrease in customer credit rating (CCR), is a key judgement within the ECL methodology, as this criterion determines if a
forward-looking 12 month or lifetime allowance is recorded.
Additionally, allowances for individually assessed wholesale loans exceeding specific thresholds are assessed. We exercise significant judgement in
challenging the assessment of specific allowances based on the expected future cash repayments and estimated proceeds from the value of the
collateral held in respect of the loans.
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Our audit procedures for the allowance for ECL included assessing significant accounting policies against the requirements of the accounting
standard. Additionally, our procedures included testing key controls in relation to:
• The ECL model governance and validation processes which involved assessment of model performance;
• The assessment and approval of the forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenario weightings through challenge applied by internal
governance processes;
• Reconciliation of the data used in the ECL calculation process to gross balances recorded within the general ledger as well as source systems;
• Customer credit rating (CCR) for wholesale loans (larger customer exposures are monitored individually). This covered elements such as: approval
of new lending facilities against lending policies, monitoring of counterparty credit quality against exposure criteria for internal factors specific to
the counterparty or external macroeconomic factors, and accuracy and timeliness of CCR and security indicator (SI) assessments against lending
policies and regulatory requirements;
• IT system controls which record retail loans lending arrears, group exposures into delinquency buckets, and re-calculate individual allowances. We
tested automated calculation and change management controls and evaluated the oversight of the portfolios, with a focus on controls over
delinquency monitoring.
We tested relevant General Information Technology Controls (GITCs) in relation to the key IT applications used in measuring ECL allowances as
detailed in the IT Systems and Controls key audit matter below.
In addition to controls testing, our procedures included:
• Reperforming a sample of credit assessments for wholesale loans controlled by workout and recovery teams assessed as higher risk or impaired,
and a sample of other loans, focusing on larger exposures assessed by the Group as showing signs of deterioration, or in areas of emerging risk.
• For each loan sampled, we challenged the Group’s assessment of CCR and SI using the customer’s financial position, the valuation of security, and,
where relevant, the risk of stranded assets, to inform our overall assessment of loan recoverability and the impact on the credit allowance. To do
this, we used the information on the Group’s loan file and discussed the facts and circumstances of the case with the loan officer.
• Exercising our judgement, our procedures included using our understanding of relevant industries and the macroeconomic environment and
comparing data and assumptions used by the Group in recoverability assessments to externally sourced evidence, such as commodity prices,
publicly available audited financial statements and comparable external valuations of collateral held. Where relevant, we assessed the forecast
timing of future cash flows in the context of underlying valuations and approved business plans and challenged key assumptions in the valuations;
• Obtaining an understanding of the Group’s processes to determine ECL allowances, evaluating the ECL model methodologies against established
market practices and criteria in the accounting standards;

KEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)
• Working with our credit risk specialists, we assessed the accuracy of the ECL model estimates by re-performing, for a sample of loans, the
calculation of the ECL allowance using our independently derived calculation tools and comparing this to the amount recorded by the Group;
• Working with our economic specialists, we challenged the forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenarios incorporated in the ECL
models. We compared the forecast GDP, unemployment rates, CPI and property price indices to relevant publicly available macroeconomic
information, and considered other known variables and information obtained through our other audit procedures to identify contradictory
indicators;
• Testing the implementation of SICR methodology by re-performing the staging calculation for a sample of loans taking into consideration
movements in the CCR from loan origination and comparing our result to actual staging applied on an individual account level in the ECL model;
• Assessing the accuracy of the data used in the ECL models by checking a sample of data fields such as account balance and CCR to relevant source
systems.
We challenged key assumptions used in post-model adjustments. This included:
• Assessing post-model adjustments against ECL model and data deficiencies identified in model validation processes, particularly in light of the
significant volatility in economic scenarios;
• Comparing underlying data used in concentration risk and economic cycle allowances to underlying loan portfolio characteristics of recent loss
experience, current market conditions and specific risks in the loan portfolios;
• Assessing certain post-model adjustments identified against internal and external information;
• Assessing the completeness of post-model adjustments by checking the consistency of risks we identified in the loan portfolios against the Group’s
assessment.
• Assessing the appropriateness of the Group’s disclosures in the Financial Report using our understanding obtained from our testing and against
the requirements of the accounting standards.
SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD AT FAIR VALUE:
- FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 ASSET POSITIONS $2,151m
- FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 ASSET POSITIONS $135,711m
- FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 LIABILITY POSITIONS $23m
- FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 LIABILITY POSITIONS $92,892m
Refer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures of fair values in Note 19 to the Financial Report.
The key audit matter
The fair value of the Group’s Level 3 and 2 financial instruments is determined by the application of valuation techniques which often involve the
exercise of judgement and the use of assumptions and estimates.
In assessing this Key Audit Matter, we involved our valuation specialists to supplement our senior team members who understand the methods,
assumptions and data relevant to the valuation of financial instruments.
The valuation of Level 3 and Level 2 financial instruments held at fair value is a Key Audit Matter due to:
• The high degree of estimation uncertainty and potentially significant range of reasonable outcomes associated with the valuation of financial
instruments classified as Level 3 where significant pricing inputs used in the valuation methodology and models are not observable.
• The complexity associated with the valuation methodology and models of certain more complex Level 2 financial instruments including credit
valuation adjustment (CVA) and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) leading to an increase in subjectivity and estimation uncertainty.
These factors increased the level of judgement applied by us and our audit effort thereon.
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Our audit procedures in relation to the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value included:
• Performing an assessment of the population of financial instruments held at fair value by the Group to identify portfolios with a higher risk of
misstatement arising from significant judgements over valuation either due to unobservable inputs or complex models.
• Testing the design and operating effectiveness of key controls relating specifically to these financial instruments, including those in relation to:
• Independent Price Verification (IPV), including completeness of portfolios and valuation inputs subject to IPV;
• model validation at inception and periodically, including assessment of model limitation and assumptions;
• review, approval and challenge of daily profit and loss by a control function;
• collateral management process, including review and approval of margin reconciliations with clearing houses; and
• review and approval of CVA and FVA, including exit price and portfolio level adjustments.

KEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)
• In relation to the subjective valuation of complex Level 2 and Level 3 financial instruments, with our valuation specialists:
• Assessing the reasonableness of key inputs and assumptions using comparable data in the market and available alternatives;
• Comparing the Group’s valuation methodology to industry practice and the criteria in the accounting standards; and
• Independently revaluing a selection of financial instruments and CVA/FVA. This involved sourcing independent inputs from comparable data in
the market and available alternatives. We challenged and assessed any differences.
• Assessing the appropriateness of the Group’s disclosures in the Financial Report using our understanding obtained from our testing and against
the requirements of the accounting standards.
CARRYING VALUE OF INVESTMENT IN PT PANIN ($1,440m)
Refer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures in Note 28 to the Financial Report.
The key audit matter
The carrying value of the Group’s investment in PT Panin is a key audit matter due to the impairment indicators identified at the reporting date and
the assessment of the investment’s recoverable amount involving judgement and the consideration of valuation models given historical volatility in
the market price of the shares. Impairment has been recognised in prior periods. We involved our valuation specialists to supplement our senior team
members in assessing this key audit matter.
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Working with our valuation specialists, our procedures included:
• Considering the appropriateness of the recoverable amount assessment used to conclude the carrying value of the investment is supportable;
• Considering the appropriateness of the value in use valuation method applied against the requirements of the accounting standards. This
included:
• Assessing the integrity of the models used, including the accuracy of the underlying calculation formulas;
• Assessing the key assumptions used in the models, such as, discount rates, forecast earnings and terminal growth rates by comparing to
external observable metrics, historical experience, our knowledge of the markets and current market practice;
• Independently developing discount rates range considered comparable using publicly available market data for comparable entities, adjusted
for factors specific to the investments and the markets and industry they operate in;
• Comparing the forecast earnings contained in the model to broker consensus reports and released financial results;
• Assessing the accuracy of previous forecasts to inform our evaluation of current forecasts incorporated in the model; and
• Considering the sensitivity of the models by varying key assumptions, such as, discount rates, forecast cash flows and terminal growth rates,
within a reasonable possible range. We did this to identify those assumptions at higher risk of bias or inconsistency in application and to focus
our further procedures.
• Assessing the recoverable amount at the reporting date against the recoverable amount of the investment when it was last impaired to critically
assess potential reversal of previous impairment losses;
• Assessing the Group’s disclosures in the Financial Report using our understanding obtained from our testing and against the requirements of the
accounting standards.
IT SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS
The key audit matter
As a major Australian bank, the businesses utilise many complex, interdependent Information Technology (IT) systems to process and record a high
volume of transactions. The controls over access, changes to and operation of IT systems are key to the recording of financial information and the
preparation of a financial report which provides a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position and performance.
The IT systems and controls, as they impact the financial recording and reporting of transactions, is a key audit matter as our audit approaches could
significantly differ depending on the effective operation of the IT controls. We work with our IT specialists as a core part of our audit team.
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Our testing focused on the technology control environments for key IT applications (systems) used in processing significant transactions and
recording balances in the general ledgers, and the automated controls embedded within these systems which link the technology-enabled business
processes. Our audit procedures included:
• Assessing the governance and higher-level controls across the IT environments, including those regarding policy design, policy review and
awareness, and IT Risk and cyber security management practices;

KEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)
• Design and operating effectiveness testing of key controls across the user access management lifecycle, including how users are on-boarded,
reviewed for access levels assigned, and removed on a timely basis from key IT applications and supporting infrastructure. We also examined the
management of privileged roles and functions across relevant IT application and the supporting infrastructure;
• Design and operating effectiveness testing of key controls for IT change management including authorisation of changes prior to development,
testing performed and approvals prior to migration into the production environment of key IT applications. We assessed user access to release
changes to IT application production environments and whether access was commensurate with their job responsibilities;
• Design and operating effectiveness testing of key controls used by the technology teams to restrict access to and monitor system batch job
schedules;
• Design and operating effectiveness testing of key automated business process controls including those relating to enforcing segregation of duties
to avoid conflicts from inappropriate role combinations within IT applications. Our testing included:
• Configurations to perform calculations, mappings and flagging of financial transactions, and automated reconciliation controls (both between
systems and intra-system); and
• Data integrity of key system reporting used by us in our audit to select samples and analyse data used to generate financial reporting.
• Where our testing identified design and operating effectiveness matters relating to IT systems or application controls relevant to our audit, we
performed alternative audit procedures, including consideration of mitigating controls.

assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report and our related assurance opinion.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Report, our responsibility is to read the Other Information. In doing so, we consider whether the Other
Information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated.
We are required to report if we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this Other Information, and based on the work we have performed
on the Other Information that we obtained prior to the date of this Auditor’s Report we have nothing to report.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE FINANCIAL REPORT
The Directors are responsible for:
• preparing the Financial Report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001
• implementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a Financial Report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error
• assessing the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and whether the use of the going concern basis of accounting is
appropriate. This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they
