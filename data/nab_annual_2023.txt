Acknowledgement of Country
NAB acknowledges Australia’s First Nations people as the Traditional Custodians of the land and their continuing
connection to country, sea and water. We pay respect to their Elders past and present.
We make this acknowledgement with the ambition to continue supporting a reconciled Australia through our actions and
voice. This is backed by why we are here: to serve customers well and help our communities prosper.
“Indigenous Australians”, "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander" and "First Nations people" (or "First Nations Australians")

them. the experience.
Simple products and a seamless experience
NAB is working to make all our products easy to understand
and use. In 2023, this work included more ways to manage
home loans online, in-app notifications and expansion of
digital wallet capabilities.
Since the launch of NAB Messaging, NAB has served more than
500,000 customers through the channel, helping them manage
banking enquiries in their own time. Customers can now 'leave
a message' for NAB to respond to and get on with their day.
NAB is building towards a one-way home lending application
experience across all channels and an improved experience
for customers, colleagues and brokers. NAB has demonstrated
strong progress towards its aim of delivering Australia’s
simplest home loan with 70% of all proprietary home loans and
15% of broker home loans now submitted via Simple Home
Loans (SHL). ~70% of retail home loans submitted via SHL
achieve time-to-unconditional-approval in less than a day(1),
while most of our broker customers receive unconditional
approval same-day through SHL.
Following the completion of the 86 400 integration in 2023,
ubank customers can link accounts from other banks,
superannuation and investment providers to see a full picture
of their wealth.
BNZ has delivered innovative solutions to help make it simpler
and easier for customers to manage their finances. BNZ’s easy
to use online repayment features enable customers to
manage their mortgage repayments online. BNZ’s recently
launched MyProperty empowers customers with more
information so they can better plan ahead for future interest
rate changes. BNZ has simplified fees across a range of
products, including removing international payment fees and
monthly account fees on BNZ’s TotalMoney account.
Faster and decisive banking
Modernising NAB's technology is helping our colleagues serve
customers faster. Home loan approval times for customers
and brokers have improved, while automation and process
improvements reduced onboarding time for Corporate and
Institutional customers in 2023.
NAB’s instant credit decisioning capabilities are critical to
providing customers with speed and certainty when they
apply. A key focus has been on automating the customer
authentication and verification journey, and pre-filling known
customer data in applications. These improvements save time
and make it easier for customers when applying for
transaction accounts, savings and new products like NAB Now

Resilient technology and operations
NAB’s strategy is to develop leading resilient technology so
that customers and colleagues can depend on us. There has
been significant progress in reducing service interruptions
with the number of critical and high incidents dropping 83%
since 2018.
In 2023, NAB intensified focus on security in the face of ever-
escalating cyber threats. This year 33 initiatives have been
completed as part of a bank-wide strategy to address the
global scam epidemic, including removing links in unexpected
texts to customers. This work follows efforts by NAB, together
with telecommunications providers, to prevent spoofing
scams by stopping criminals infiltrating and impersonating
phone numbers and legitimate text message threads.
Having a strong, capable and internal technology workforce
is a key enabler of its strategy. NAB continues to insource
key technology functions to get the right skills to operate
sustainably. The infrastructure insourcing program is largely
completed and the focus is now on further building strategic
skill sets in cyber, data, digital and artificial intelligence (AI)
which are critical to modern technology platforms. NAB's
India and Vietnam-based innovation centres are a significant
part of our strategy, increasing collaboration with Australia-
based teams.
In 2018, NAB adopted a "cloud first" strategy. Since then,
NAB has migrated over 77% of applications to cloud-based
platforms. This has been critical in building more resilience in
our systems.

chance of the RBNZ tightening further, the most likely next
change in the OCR is a cut.
Looking ahead, economic growth is likely to be weak into
the first half of calendar 2024, before recovering, which
is expected to lead to an increase in the unemployment
rate. This outlook reflects the lagged impact of monetary
policy tightening, curtailed commodity income, reductions in
government spending, and weaker goods exports due to slow
global growth and weather-related reductions in agricultural
output. Fiscal policy settings are also uncertain with the
formation of a new government following October’s election.
Outlook
The outlook for the Group’s financial performance and
outcomes is closely linked to the levels of economic activity in
each of the Group’s key markets that are outlined above.

Sustainability approach
Sustainability in NAB's strategy
The future depends on acting now for the long-term.
NAB employs more than 38,000(1) colleagues, serves about 10 million customers and is connected to communities across Australia
and New Zealand. That scale and connectivity is critical to NAB's ability to drive positive change. Sustainability is embedded in the
long-term pillar of NAB's strategy in recognition of the impact that successfully managing sustainability matters can have on our
business and the environment and communities we operate in.
NAB has prioritised the areas where it can have the biggest positive impact. NAB determined these priority areas through
its sustainability materiality process and impact analysis following guidance of the United Nations Principles for Responsible
Banking (UN PRB). The Group’s approach to managing climate-related risks and opportunities is detailed in the standalone

Social, affordable and community housing

housing financing body, Housing Australia, to help create
the right financing conditions to build scale in social and
affordable housing aligned with the Federal Government’s
ambition for 40,000 social and affordable homes by 2029.
This year NAB helped to finance social, affordable and
community housing transactions which included build to
rent, land lease and mixed tenure models. NAB is focused
on connecting and influencing key stakeholders through
networks in the affordable housing sector, and working
closely with community partners like Good Shepherd and the
Salvation Army.
Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA)
Life with disability can make finding a liveable home harder. In
2023, NAB has financed the construction of some significant
specialist homes for people living with disability. This
included finance to the Australian Disability Accommodation
Projects(2). Working with Lighthouse Infrastructure and a
consortium of lenders, this is NAB’s largest commitment in
the SDA sector to date, and the first social loan for SDA
in Australia.
First Home Guarantee Scheme
NAB is helping people earning incomes under the national
median, access home ownership as part of the First Home
Guarantee (FHG) scheme which has established income and
other eligibility criteria. NAB’s affordable and specialist housing
target includes a subset of loans provided via the FHG, for
loans where applicants have a total taxable income under the
national median, and for properties with a price under the
national median. NAB is a founding bank in this scheme and in
2023 has financed loans in this subset housing, approximately
5,127 borrowers.
The growth of this scheme shows government, business and
community providers, all play a key role in making home
ownership more accessible. NAB is consulting with the Federal
Government on its new Help to Buy scheme, a shared equity
access program for low-income earners, announced in 2022.
(1) Affordable and specialist housing includes affordable housing, specialist disability accommodation and sustainable housing. This includes loans made under the First
Home Guarantee and Family Home Guarantee, as part of the Home Guarantee Scheme for properties under the national median house price, and for borrowers with
taxable income below the national median household income. Progress is based on total lending facilities committed, where first draw down occurred during the target
period, or additional funding was provided during the target period for a pre-existing loan facility. This number does not reflect debt balance.

(2) The pay gap analysis indicates NAB’s gender pay gap when comparing the base salary of all females to males within the Australian-based workforce of NAB, for the
reporting period 1st April 2022 to 31 March 2023. The ratio is calculated by dividing the female average salary by the male average salary per employment level. It does

gaps for 2021 and 2022 reflect Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) published figures. Note at time of reporting WGEA figures were not published for 2023, these
figures represent NAB calculated gender pay gaps following the WGEA methodology.
(3) The inclusive workforce culture scores are based off responses to NAB's Heartbeat survey conducted in July 2023 (2023 score), August 2022 (2022 score) and July
2021 (2021 score). The methodology was revised in 2022 to measure the differences on an inclusion score, based on a combined response to three questions: 1. 'I feel
comfortable being myself at work'. 2. 'I am treated with respect and dignity' and 3. 'Regardless of background, everyone at our company has an equal opportunity to
succeed'. The table represents the scores for specific historically under-represented groups, with comparisons to the related majority group within the workforce.
(4) ubank did not participate in the demographic section of Heartbeat survey in 2023, therefore no ubank data is included in the inclusion scores that are reported for
2023. ubank data is included in 2022 and 2021 inclusion scores.
(5) Inclusion score is calculated using responses to questions in Heartbeat survey, with gender of respondents based on how this is recorded in SAP.
(6) Colleagues who selected that they identify as a person with disability in the Heartbeat survey.
(7) The methodology used in defining ethnic minority was altered this year, to take into account NAB’s growth in international colleagues. Ethnic minority and non-ethnic
minority calculations only include colleagues from Australia, NZ, UK and US. The ethnic minority group is comprised of individuals whose ethnicity is considered to be
an ethnic minority in those included regions. Colleagues based in other regions have not been included in the calculation this year, as identification of ethnic minority
would be different in those regions
(8) Categories were expanded in 2022 to include asexual, homosexual, pansexual and non-binary or other genders. Other categories include lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, agender, bigender, another gender, intersex and different identity.
(9) Colleagues who selected they spend time providing unpaid care, help, or assistance to family members or others with a disability (including children, adults or
older adults).

Climate change and environment
NAB's climate strategy is aligned to our strategic ambition - to serve customers well and help our
communities prosper. We acknowledge that climate change is a significant risk to the planet and a
major challenge for society to address. Beyond this risk, there is an immense economic opportunity
as the world transitions to a low-carbon future. We are working with customers as they decarbonise,
adapt and build resilience, while pursuing new climate opportunities for a prosperous future.
Climate strategy
NAB is seeking to act as a catalyst for climate action through the financing we provide and the insights we share with customers.
NAB is supporting customers to reduce their emissions and has set targets to align with pathways to net zero by 2050,
consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. This approach is underpinned by core
beliefs including:
• Climate transition can create growth for the economy.
• Management of climate transition is core to our business, not an adjacency.
• Our approach is relationship-led, supported by strong enabling capabilities.
• Sector decarbonisation targets should be science-based.
This section of the report provides a summary of activities and performance in 2023, guided by the Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, with detailed TCFD aligned disclosures and an update on our Net Zero Banking
Alliance (NZBA) interim 2030 sector decarbonisation targets (decarbonisation targets), available in NAB's 2023 Climate Report,
available at nab.com.au/annualreports.
NAB's climate strategy is aligned to the Group’s strategic ambition to serve customers well and help communities prosper. The
appointment of our first Chief Climate Officer, in addition to an increased focus on banker climate training and colleagues’
climate capabilities, helps support NAB’s whole-of-bank approach to its climate strategy and to help achieve emissions
reduction consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. Business Unit climate change
strategies are in place across Business and Private Banking, Personal Banking, Corporate and Institutional Banking and BNZ.
Our climate strategy also captures our operational emissions ambition, including emissions from our international offices where
applicable, in addition to the capability of our colleagues in supporting our customers through the transition. Our focus remains
on maximising economic benefits for customers and shareholders, to support customers as they decarbonise, adapt and build
resilience, while pursuing new climate opportunities and creating prosperity.
NAB's strategic climate priorities
BNZ's climate strategy
Given the country and economy-specific climate-related risks and opportunities for the BNZ, BNZ has its own climate
strategy, is a member of the NZBA and is setting its own sector decarbonisation targets to meet its NZBA commitment.

Assessing nature-related impacts and dependencies
The LEAP guidance suggests that organisations evaluate their material nature-related impacts and dependencies to understand
where risks and opportunities may arise. During 2023, NAB undertook a preliminary assessment of its nature-related impacts and
dependencies. A summary of the results of this assessment is provided in Figure 3.
Defining nature-related impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities
The TNFD draws on the following definitions with respect to nature:
Impacts. Changes in the state of nature (quality or quantity), which may result in changes to the capacity of nature to provide social and
economic functions. Impacts can be positive or negative. They can be the result of an organisation’s or another party’s actions and can
be direct, indirect or cumulative.
Dependencies. Dependencies are aspects of environmental assets and ecosystem services that a person or an organization relies
on to function. A company’s business model, for example, may be dependent on the ecosystem services of water flow, water quality
regulation and the regulation of hazards like fires and floods; provision of suitable habitat for pollinators, who in turn provide a service
directly to economies; and carbon sequestration.
Risks. Potential threats (effects of uncertainty) posed to an organisation that arise from its and wider society’s dependencies and
impacts on nature.
Opportunities. Activities that create positive outcomes for organisations and nature by creating positive impacts on nature or mitigating
negative impacts on nature. Nature-related opportunities are generated through impacts and dependencies on nature.
Source: TNFD glossary (Version 1.0, September 2023)
The analysis identified that the most material customer-related impacts on nature are associated with the agriculture,
construction, manufacturing, mining, energy and utilities industries, and transport and storage. The highest impacts on nature
across the portfolio relate to land and water use, GHG emissions and waste production.
The industries that were found to have the most material dependencies on nature were: agriculture, fishing, forestry, energy and
utilities. The preliminary analysis identified that the key dependencies customers have on nature-related matters are: climate
regulation, fibres and other materials, flood and storm protection, access to ground and surface water.
The assessment draws on the global Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and Exposure (ENCORE) tool developed by the
UNEP World Conservation and Monitoring Centre. A number of adjustments were required to better reflect the Australian and NAB
context. Owing to these adjustments, NAB will continue to refine its assessment. The finalised assessment will contribute to the
TNFD roadmap the Group is developing.
Figure 3: Preliminary assessment of NAB's lending portfolio and nature-related impact and dependency areas
Notes: The ENCORE tool assesses impacts and dependencies across 11 sectors, 138 sub-industries and 86 processes. These
categories were manually aligned to sectoral/industry groupings used by NAB. For some areas, it was not possible to achieve
complete alignment, resulting in the following portfolio areas being excluded from the assessment: personal lending, residential
mortgages, commercial property, and government. To gain greater insights, some industry groupings were disaggregated,
e.g. agriculture, fishing, forestry and mining were assessed as separate categories. Within the tool, 11 aspects of natural
capital impact are considered, including non-GHG air pollution, solid waste, water pollutants and water use. For dependencies,
29 aspects are considered, including animal-based resources, plant-based resources, flood protection, and pollination.
These impacts and dependencies were reviewed with reference to NAB’s industry categories and with respect to common
Australian production processes. The assessment has been undertaken from the perspective of the primary industry of
impact or dependency. For example, 'Telecommunication' considers the operation of telecommunication businesses, whereas
‘construction’ considers the impact of telecommunication-related construction activities.

Investing in security
NAB continues to build a sophisticated security function to
protect our business, our customers, and the community from
evolving cyber security threats.
Cyber security is recognised as one of NAB’s key risks, and
is closely monitored with regular updates on the threat
landscape, security strategy, capability, incidents, issues and
progress on risk reduction and performance metrics.
NAB has made progress on our refreshed security strategy,
to strengthen our security foundations and has significantly
improved security capability aligned to the National Institute
of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Cyber Security
Framework (CSF). External firms independently review and test
this security capability.
Having world-class security talent is critical. In 2023 our
security colleagues participated in specialist training and/or
certification from global security providers.
NAB has expanded our security workforce across multiple
regions globally, extending coverage and capability around
the clock.
NAB is focused on a collaborative approach to drive national
outcomes that protect businesses and individuals from cyber-
enabled crime. As part of this approach NAB is partnering with
Security Centres, agencies and research groups.
NAB has strengthened and uplifted its governance
frameworks, associated reporting and forums. This has
enabled NAB to improve visibility, oversight, consistency in
security posture, capability maturity, and achieve broader
business benefits across NAB.

to mitigate the risk of financial crime at NAB, including
on money laundering / terrorism financing, bribery and
corruption, sanctions, and scams and fraud.
The past 18 months of sanctions, export, and import controls
have been unprecedented in their scope, complexity, and
impact. Enforcement by global sanctions regulators remains
significant, with USD 1 billion in penalties issued globally in
financial year 2023. To ensure compliance NAB has continued
to improve its Sanctions Compliance Program, including
implementing a new trade screening program and enhancing
our controls for the identification and monitoring of high
sanctions risk customers.
NAB also plays a crucial role by collaborating with law
enforcement, alliances and Government agencies in Australia
to combat financial crimes impacting our community,
colleagues and customers. This helps NAB identify, investigate
and/or disrupt money laundering, fraud, national security, drug
trafficking and human impact crimes, which have detrimental
impacts to our society.
NAB continues to execute the financial crime strategy which
was launched in 2022. While NAB is making good progress, the
nature of the threat and risk it presents requires ongoing
vigilance and pursuit of best practice in all that NAB does.

Origination and internal review
As part of the credit risk assessment and due diligence
process, colleagues in both NAB Business Banking and
Corporate & Institutional Banking Divisions are required
to undertake negative media screening on customers at
origination and internal review.
If potential ESG risk issues are identified as part of this risk-
based screening, or bankers note a customer's involvement
in high-risk sectors or activities, then customers are subject
to more detailed ESG risk assessment and due diligence in
accordance with exposure-related trigger thresholds, as part
of the Group’s origination or ongoing credit review processes.

Independent Limited Assurance Report to the Management and
Directors of National Australia Bank Limited
Our Conclusion
Ernst & Young (‘EY’, ‘we’) were engaged by National Australia Bank Limited (‘NAB’) to undertake
limited assurance as defined by Australian Auditing Standards, hereafter referred to as a ‘review’ over
the Subject Matter defined below for the year ended 30 September 2023. Based on the procedures we
have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us
to believe the Subject Matter has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the
Criteria defined below.
What Our Review Covered
We reviewed NAB’s preparation and application of its materiality process for NAB’s ESG material
themes against the Criteria of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 2023 Standard’s Materiality
Principle for defining reporting content, as included in NAB’s 2023 Annual Report (“AR”).
We also reviewed the following performance metrics and disclosures for the year ended 30 September
2023:

scope of our engagement, we did not perform assurance procedures on the remaining information
included in the Report, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or conclusion on this
information.

Key Responsibilities
EY’s Responsibility and Independence
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Subject Matter based on our review.
We have complied with the independence and relevant ethical requirements, which are founded on
fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality
and professional behaviour. The firm applies Auditing Standard ASQM 1 Quality Management for Firms
that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, or Other
Assurance or Related Services Engagements, which requires the firm to design, implement and
operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with
ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
NAB’s Responsibility
NAB’s management is responsible for selecting the Criteria, and for presenting the materiality process,
selected material topics and performance metrics and disclosures in accordance with that Criteria, in
all material respects. This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining internal controls,
maintaining adequate records and making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the subject
matter, such that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Our Approach to Conducting the Review
We conducted our review in accordance with the Australian Standard for Assurance Engagements
Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (‘ASAE 3000’), the Australian
Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2405 Review of Historical Financial Information Other than a
Financial Report and the terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with NAB on 10 August
2023. That standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to express a conclusion on
whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Subject Matter is not
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report.

Summary of Review Procedures Performed
A review consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for preparing the materiality
process, selected material topics, performance metrics and disclosures, and applying analytical and
other review procedures.
The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgement, including an
assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The procedures we
performed included, but were not limited to:
(cid:127) Conducting interviews with NAB personnel and collating evidence to understand NAB’s materiality
process, process for reporting selected performance metrics as well as risks of misstatement and
quality controls to address risks
(cid:127) Assessing NAB’s materiality process and conducting checks such as a media review and peer
review to support alignment with the GRI Standards materiality and completeness principles
(cid:127) Assessing the AR and SDP for disclosure and coverage of materiality process and identified
material issues in line with the GRI standards materiality and completeness principles
(cid:127) Conducting limited assurance procedures over the performance metrics and disclosures,
including:
(cid:127) Checking that the calculation Criteria have been applied in accordance with the
methodologies for the non-financial metrics
(cid:127) Checking the clerical accuracy of input data utilised to calculate selected performance
metrics
(cid:127) Undertaking analytical procedures to support the reasonableness of selected performance
metrics
(cid:127) Identifying and testing assumptions supporting calculations
(cid:127) Performing recalculations of selected performance metrics using input data and, on a
sample basis, testing underlying source information to support accuracy of selected
performance metrics
(cid:127) Assessing the accuracy and balance of statements associated with the selected
performance metrics
Inherent Limitations
Procedures performed in a review engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent
than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a
review engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a
reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Our procedures were designed to obtain a limited
level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not provide all the evidence that would be
required to provide a reasonable level of assurance.
While we considered the effectiveness of management’s internal controls when determining the nature
and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on
internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to
checking aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.

Other Matters
Our review does not extend to any disclosures or assertions made by NAB relating to future
performance plans and/or strategies disclosed in the AR and SDP. Our review extends to disclosures
of prior year figures for the metrics set out in Appendix B, with the exception of the metrics set out in
the footnote below.1
Use of Our Assurance Statement
We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this assurance report to any persons
other than management and the Directors of NAB, or for any purpose other than that for which it was
prepared.

Key Board activities
Key Board activities in 2023
• Strategy and business performance – The Board remains focused on creating sustainable shareholder value. At each major
Board meeting, the Board received reports on business performance and execution of the Group’s strategy to monitor
progress. The Board periodically received reports on execution of strategies at a business unit level to understand operating
context, as well as specific strategic initiatives, such as business acquisitions and integration, digital, data and analytics and
technology plans. The Board also reviewed and approved the Group’s corporate plan, after having several sessions with
management on strategy development.
• Technology - The Board remains focused on technology as a critical enabler of NAB’s business. At each major Board
meeting, the Board received reports from the Group Executive, Technology & Enterprise Operations, as well as updates on
the execution of NAB’s technology strategy. The Board undertook a study tour focused on core banking modernisation,
payments, cyber security and innovation, and participated in workshops with external experts and management on a
range of technology-related topics, including cyber resilience, information security, external technology developments, data
fundamentals and generative AI.
• Financial and capital management – The Board remains focused on business momentum, supporting customers and driving
growth, which requires prudent balance sheet and capital management. The Board received regular reports on financial
performance, capital, funding and liquidity. The Board approved the 2022 full year and 2023 half year financial reports,
the 2022 final and 2023 interim dividends, the capital management strategy and on-market buy-back programs. The Board
also participated in workshops on capital adequacy and stress testing, balance sheet risk management, capital and credit
provisioning and discussed lessons from bank failures in other geographies.
• Risk management – The Board remains focused on risk management, governance, accountability and culture. This focus
requires strong risk governance and an effective Risk Management Framework operated by management. The Board received
regular reports from the Group Chief Risk Officer on financial and non-financial risks, including emerging risks and issues,
and from the Group Money Laundering Reporting Officer on financial crime risk. The Board approved the risk management
strategy, the risk appetite statement and policies for managing financial and non-financial risks. The management of financial
crime risks, cyber and technology risks, and environmental and social risks were areas of focus, as well as emerging risks
related to the economic and geopolitical environment and climate vulnerability.
• People and culture – The Board remains focused on engaged, capable colleagues who are aligned to the Group’s values,
purpose and strategy. The Board received regular reports from the Group Executive, People and Culture on people-related
matters, including progress in the execution of the colleague strategy and achieving NAB’s target culture, and health, safety
and wellbeing. The Board held workshops on leadership and succession planning and met with a range of senior leaders
in formal and informal settings. The Board approved scorecards and performance outcomes for the Group CEO, Group
Executives and certain other senior executives. The Board also approved the Group Performance Indicators used for the
Group Variable Reward Plan and determined the final outcome.
• Customers – The Board and directors met with customers and customer advocates (internal and external) throughout the
year to hear their feedback and perspectives. The Board also focused on matters impacting customers, including customer
vulnerability, scams, servicing experience, cyber risks, integration of acquisitions, digital customer experience, product
governance, compliance with product and conduct obligations and customer remediation. The Board met with the Australian
Financial Complaints Authority to obtain feedback and share perspectives on priorities and industry risks and issues.
• Environmental and social – The Board debated and reviewed the Group’s decarbonisation targets to meet NAB's Net Zero
Banking Alliance commitment, after investing time in education on climate change transition. The Chair and Group CEO met
customers to hear about their approach to climate transition. The Board also met with external experts to deepen the
Board’s understanding of Indigenous affairs, including NAB's Reconciliation Action Plan and the Voice to Parliament. The Board
discussed human rights issues, approved the Modern Slavery Statement and received updates on the Group’s social impact
program and NAB Foundation.
• Regulatory and stakeholder engagement – The Board remains focused on maintaining solid relationships with regulators and
other stakeholders. The Board received regular reports on regulatory engagement, government engagement, key legal and
regulatory matters, and trust and reputation. The Board met with the Group’s main regulators throughout the year to obtain
feedback and share perspectives on priorities, industry risks and issues, and reform. The Group's Enforceable Undertaking
with AUSTRAC was a key area of focus.

Key Board activities (cont.)
Board meetings
Board meetings are an essential part of corporate governance at NAB. They are the main way for the Board to have oversight
of the Group’s strategy and performance and allow the Board to set expectations of management. The Board approves its
calendar of meetings two years in advance to ensure that directors can attend meetings. The Board has six major multi-day
meetings each year, which include committee meetings and strategy sessions, as well as other minor meetings during the year
for specific purposes. Out-of-cycle Board meetings are convened as needed for time-critical matters.
The Board’s priorities and responsibilities drive comprehensive planning and agenda-setting for meetings. The agenda
forward planner is set at the start of the year and regularly updated to reflect priorities. The forward planner is the key
framework for Board reporting and is used to balance time allocated to strategic and business topics, as well as regulatory
and legal obligations. Recurring agenda items include business performance, strategy execution and development, capital
management, financial reporting, risk management, people and culture, regulatory and other stakeholder engagement and ESG
matters. Unstructured time is also factored into Board meetings and there is flexibility for ad hoc matters to be raised. Meetings
with NAB’s main regulators are also planned at the start of the year. Agendas are reviewed by the Chair, in consultation with the
Group CEO. The same approach is adopted for forward planning and agenda-setting for each of the Board’s Committees, which
are reviewed by respective Chairs in consultation with the relevant Group Executive.
Attendance at meetings
Details of director attendance at Board and committee meetings in 2023 are set out below.
All directors receive copies of agendas, papers and minutes of committee meetings to help ensure they have equal access
to that information regardless of whether they are appointed to a particular committee. All directors may attend committee
meetings even if they are not a member of a committee. The table below excludes the attendance of directors at committee
meetings where they were not a committee member.

• The Board should consist of directors with a broad range of skills, experience and expertise, and different facets of diversity,
including gender.
• The Chair must be an independent non-executive director and must not have been a NAB executive or the Group CEO in the
previous three years.
Further detail about directors’ independence is on page 77.
NAB has a Group Fit and Proper and BEAR Suitability Policy that addresses the requirements of APRA Prudential Standard CPS 520
Fit and Proper and supports compliance with the obligations of the BEAR.
This Policy requires an annual assessment of the directors, certain members of senior management and responsible auditors,
including a determination of whether they have the appropriate competence, character, diligence, honesty, integrity and
judgement to perform their role.
The Board, with the assistance of the Nomination & Governance Committee, has reviewed and taken into consideration the
existing workload of directors and concluded that each director has sufficient capacity to undertake the duties expected of a
director of NAB.
As a Board vacancy approaches, the Nomination & Governance Committee assesses the skills and experience required, which
informs the identification of suitable candidates. The most suitable candidate is appointed by the Board after appropriate
checks are undertaken, including assessment in accordance with the Group Fit and Proper and BEAR Suitability Policy, and is
subject to election by shareholders at the next AGM.
The key terms and conditions of a director’s appointment are formally documented in a letter of appointment. This process was
followed for all directors on the Board.
Newly appointed directors must stand for election by shareholders at the next AGM. In addition, the NAB Constitution requires
that at each AGM, non-executive directors who have held office for at least three years without re-election, or beyond the
third AGM following their appointment or last election (whichever is longer) must retire from office and are eligible to stand
for re-election.
Before each AGM, the Board assesses the performance of each director due to stand for election or re-election and decides
whether to recommend to shareholders that they vote in favour of the election or re-election of each relevant director. Further
detail on NAB’s directors is provided on pages 64 to 68.
Board renewal
During the year, after consulting with the Board, the Nomination & Governance Committee reviewed the three-year Board
renewal strategy and plans. This included reviewing the highest priority skills to bring on to the Board over the short and
medium-term, considering a current vacancy and anticipated retirements at the end of 2023. The three highest priority areas
of deep competency for future director appointments were: transformation, digital, technology, data and analytics; banking; and
financial reporting and accounting. The Nomination & Governance Committee and the Board aim to identify, select and nominate
candidates who are able to contribute broadly in the boardroom, not only in areas of deep competency, and who add different
facets of diversity to the Board.
Working with an external recruitment consultant, the Nomination & Governance Committee reviewed candidate profiles and met
with candidates. During 2023, the Nomination & Governance Committee nominated three candidates to the Board, and the Board
appointed Christine Fellowes, Carolyn Kay and Alison Kitchen as non-executive directors. The three new directors will stand for
election by shareholders at the next AGM, as required under NAB’s Constitution. Further detail on NAB’s directors is provided on
pages 64 to 68.
Two directors, David Armstrong and Peeyush Gupta, will stand down from the Board following the 2023 AGM, having completed
three terms of three years.
Re-election and election of directors in 2023
In 2023, the Board has recommended in the AGM Notice of Meeting that shareholders re-elect Simon McKeon for his second
three-year term on the Board and Ann Sherry for her third term. The Board has also recommended that shareholders elect
Christine Fellowes, Carolyn Kay and Alison Kitchen to the Board for their first three-year terms. The Board has provided
shareholders with all material information that is relevant to a decision whether or not to re-elect and elect those directors
in the AGM Notice of Meeting. Further detail on NAB's directors is provided on pages 64 to 68.

Board composition, diversity and performance (cont.)
Skills matrix
Each year NAB assesses the skills and experience of each director and combined capabilities of the Board. The insights from this
assessment are documented in a skills matrix that is:
• Considered in the context of NAB’s business and its strategic needs.
• Incorporated into Board succession planning and the selection of new directors.
• Used to inform areas of focus for the Board’s continuing education and use of external expertise.
To prepare the skills matrix, each director rates their skills, expertise and experience against several competency areas that are
then mapped to the skills matrix. The self-assessment ratings and skills matrix are reviewed and calibrated by the Nomination &
Governance Committee on behalf of the Board.
The skills matrix presented here demonstrates alignment of the Board’s responsibilities with the current mix of skills on
the Board.
With the addition of new directors in 2023, the Board believes the current mix of skills, experience and expertise of directors
(as shown on the skills matrix) provides a diverse range of views and perspectives for the effective governance, oversight and
strategic leadership of NAB. The Board also invested in continuing education throughout 2023 to continue to develop directors’
competencies in the following key areas:
• Digital and technology topics – Cyber resilience; information security; core banking modernisation; data foundations; digital
assets; generative AI; and innovation in payments and cyber security technologies. This included a Board study tour and
meeting with external experts on these topics.
• Environmental and social topics – Climate transition (risks, opportunities, transition opportunities, target setting
methodologies and practices) and Indigenous matters. This included meeting with external experts on these topics.
• Risk management in banking – balance sheet risk management; capital adequacy and stress testing; capital and
credit impairment provisioning; lessons from bank failures in other geographies; financial crime risk management; crisis
management; cyber resilience; information security; and BEAR scenarios.
• People-related topics – Succession planning; health and safety; and concepts from NAB’s Distinctive Leadership Program.
• Stakeholders – Investor, customer, regulatory and government perspectives. This included meetings with representatives
from each of these areas to hear and discuss their perspectives.

Access to management and independent
professional advice
The Board and its committees have free and unfettered
access to senior management, and any other relevant internal
or external party and information, and may make any enquiries
to fulfil their responsibilities.
The Board Charter and Board Committee Operating Rules
clearly state that the Board or its committees may
engage external consultants and experts as required, and
written guidelines entitle each director to seek independent
professional advice at NAB’s expense, with the prior approval
of the Chair. The Board can conduct or direct any investigation
to fulfil its responsibilities and can retain, at NAB’s expense,
any legal, accounting or other services that it considers
necessary from time to time to fulfil its duties.
Director and executive
shareholding requirements
To align with shareholders’ interests, the Board has adopted
a policy that within five years of appointment, non-executive
directors must hold ordinary shares equal in value of the
annual Chair fee for the Chair and base fee for all other non-
executive directors.
The value of a non-executive director’s shareholding is based
on the share price at the time shares were acquired.
Other than the three new directors, non-executive directors
have met their minimum shareholding requirement.
Newly appointed non-executive directors are expected to
acquire shares each year until the minimum requirement is
met by the end of year 5.
Minimum shareholding requirements for the Executive
Leadership Team are:
• Group CEO: two times fixed remuneration.
• Group Executives: one times fixed remuneration.
Newly appointed Executive Leadership Team members are
required to satisfy the minimum shareholding requirement
within a five-year period from the date of commencement in
their role.
The Group CEO and other Group Executives have met, or are on
track to meet their minimum shareholding requirement.

Subsidiary boards
NAB has a number of subsidiary companies. The activities of each subsidiary company in the Group are overseen by that
company’s own board of directors. The Board’s confidence in the activities of its controlled entities stems from the quality of
the directors on those subsidiary boards and their commitment to NAB’s objectives. NAB has one significant subsidiary, BNZ.
The Chair of the BNZ Board is Doug McKay who is also a NAB director. NAB directors have a standing invitation to attend board
meetings of BNZ to develop a broader understanding of its operations.
The Group's subsidiary governance framework sets out the corporate governance requirements for subsidiaries operating within
the Group environment including different roles and responsibilities of subsidiaries, their boards and management.

How We Work
Governance, conduct and culture
The Board approves NAB’s purpose, values and Code of Conduct to underpin the desired culture within NAB’s business
and oversees the establishment by management of a culture that is focused on sound risk management and customer
outcomes. NAB's refreshed strategy, released in 2020, clearly stated why NAB is here: to serve customers well and help our
communities prosper.
NAB values and culture
NAB updated its company values in 2020 in conjunction with a refresh of its Strategy. These values, known as How We Work,
identify the core elements of behaviour expected of colleagues for NAB to deliver its strategy and clearly articulate its
target culture.
The below articulation of “what we do” and “what we don’t do” provides guidance for all colleagues to understand the standards
expected at NAB. How We Work is the basis of NAB’s Code of Conduct and integrated into its performance management
framework. To strengthen NAB's commitment to service delivery and serving its customers well, the "excellence for customers"
value was updated in 2023.
How We Work has been approved by the Board and is summarised below.
To achieve NAB's target culture, the Colleague Strategy was established to deliver the goal of having trusted professionals who
are proud to be a part of NAB. NAB's strategic aspirations include:
Talented professionals who shape the future of banking Inclusive culture we can be proud of

regions in which it operates. The average value of regulatory
liquid assets held through the September 2023 quarter was
$210 billion which was comprised of $209 billion of HQLA and
$1 billion of RBNZ repo-eligible securities.
The Group's LCR averaged 140% during the September quarter,

A detailed breakdown of quarterly average net cash outflows

Dividend and Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP)
The final dividend in respect of the year ended 30 September
2023 has been increased to 84 cents, 100% franked, payable on
15 December 2023.
The extent to which future dividends on ordinary shares
and distributions on frankable hybrids will be franked is
not guaranteed and will depend on a number of factors,
including capital management activities and the level of
profits generated by the Group that will be subject to tax
in Australia.
The Group periodically adjusts its DRP to reflect its capital
position and outlook. The DRP discount for the 2023 final
dividend is nil. Eligible shareholders have the ability to
participate in the DRP for the 2023 final dividend for up
to 5 million NAB ordinary shares per participant. The Group
expects to satisfy the DRP in full by an on-market purchase
of shares.

commission) in which the officer becomes involved (including, without limitation, appearing as a witness or producing
documents) because of that capacity.
• Legal costs incurred in good faith in obtaining legal advice on issues relevant to the performance of their functions and
discharge of their duties as an officer, if that expenditure has been approved in accordance with the terms of any applicable
deed or agreement entered into pursuant to article 20.3 or any applicable policy of the Company, except to the extent that:
– The Company is forbidden by law to indemnify the person against the liability or legal costs, or
– An indemnity by the Company of the person against the liability or legal costs, if given, would be made void by law.
Under Article 20.2, the Company may pay or agree to pay, whether directly or through an interposed entity, a premium for a
contract insuring a person who is or has been an officer against liability incurred by the person in that capacity, including a
liability for legal costs, unless:
• The Company is forbidden by law to pay or agree to pay the premium, or
• The contract would, if the Company paid the premium, be made void by law.
The Company may enter into an agreement with a person referred to in Articles 20.1 and 20.2 with respect to the subject matter
of those Articles. Such an agreement may include provisions relating to rights of access to the books of the Company . In
the context of Article 20, ‘officer’ means a director, secretary or senior manager of NAB or of a related body corporate of
the Company.
The Company has executed deeds of indemnity in favour of each director of NAB and certain directors of related bodies
corporate of the Company. Some companies within the Group have extended equivalent deeds of indemnity in favour of
directors of those companies.
Directors' and officers' insurance
During the year, the Company, pursuant to Article 20, paid a premium for a contract insuring all directors, secretaries, executive
officers and officers of the Company and of each related body corporate of the Company. The contract does not provide
cover for the independent auditors of the Company or of a related body corporate of the Company. In accordance with usual
commercial practice, the insurance contract prohibits disclosure of the premium payable, the policy limits and the nature of the
liabilities covered.

exercise of a right.
For further details on rights refer to Note 35 Equity-based plans of the notes to the financial statements and Section 7.4 of the
Remuneration Report.
Future developments
In the opinion of the directors, discussion or disclosure of any further future developments including the Group’s business
strategies and its prospects for future financial years would be likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the interests of
the Group.
Proceedings on behalf of NAB
There are no proceedings brought or intervened in, or applications to bring or intervene in proceedings, on behalf of NAB by a
member or other person entitled to do so under section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
Events subsequent to reporting date
There are no items, transactions or events of a material or unusual nature that have arisen in the period between 30 September
2023 and the date of this report that, in the opinion of the directors, have significantly affected or may significantly affect the
operations of the Group, the results of those operations or the state of affairs of the Group in future years.
Integrity of reporting
The directors of NAB have a responsibility with respect to the integrity of external reporting. This involves reviewing and
monitoring, with the assistance of the Board Audit Committee and management, the processes, controls and procedures which
are in place to maintain the integrity of the Group’s financial statements.
Further details on the role of the Board and its committees can be found in NAB's 2023 Corporate Governance Statement in the

External auditor
EY were appointed as the Group external auditor on 31 January 2005 and have provided the audit opinion on the Financial Report
for 19 years. Mr Tim Dring was appointed on 16 December 2022 as the Group's Lead Partner succeeding Ms Sarah Lowe on the
completion of her five-year tenure. The Audit Committee conducts an annual review of the adequacy of the external audit with
emphasis on effectiveness, performance and independence of the external auditor. The Audit Committee resolved EY should
continue as the Group's external auditor.
There is no person who has acted as an officer of the Group during the 2023 financial year who has previously been a partner at
EY when that firm conducted the Group's audit.
Non-audit services, audit-related, taxation-related services
The remuneration of the external auditor is set out in Note 34 Remuneration of external auditor of the notes to the financial
statements and includes details of the fees paid or due and payable for audit-related, taxation-related and non-audit services
provided by EY to the Group during 2023.
In accordance with advice received from the Board Audit Committee, the directors are satisfied that the provision of audit-
related, taxation-related and non-audit services during the year to 30 September 2023 by EY is compatible with the general
standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The directors are satisfied because the
Board Audit Committee or its delegate has assessed each service, having regard to auditor independence requirements of
applicable laws, rules and regulations, and concluded that the provision of each service or type of service would not impair the
independence of EY.
A description of the Board Audit Committee’s pre-approval policies and procedures is set out in the Assurance and Control
section on page 84. A copy of EY’s independence declaration is set out on page 156.

1.2 Executive remuneration framework in 2023
The Group remuneration principles inform the remuneration framework for the Group CEO and Group Executives. The framework
reinforces our commitment to customers, aligns with sustainable shareholder value creation and reflects risk, reputation,
conduct, sustainability and values (How We Work) outcomes. The framework supports the Group CEO and Group Executives
to drive both short and long term performance. The requirement to hold a minimum shareholding enhances the alignment
between the interests of shareholders and the Group CEO and Group Executives. The diagram below illustrates the executive
remuneration framework that applied to the Group CEO and Group Executives in 2023.

Minimum shareholding requirement
No change was made to the executive minimum shareholding requirement in 2023.
To align with shareholder interests, executives are required to hold NAB shares to the value of two times FR (for the Group CEO) and one
times FR (for Group Executives). Newly appointed executives are required to satisfy the minimum shareholding requirement within a
five-year period from the date of commencement in their role.
The value of an executive’s shareholding is based on the share price on the last day of the financial year (i.e., 30 September).
The Group CEO and Group Executives have either met or are on track to meet their minimum shareholding requirement.
Holdings included in meeting the minimum shareholding requirement are NAB shares, unvested deferred shares and deferred rights
not subject to further performance conditions held by the executive, and shares held by a closely related party or self-managed
superannuation fund for the benefit of the executive.
(1) The outcome for the Managing Director and CEO, Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) will vary depending on overall Group and BNZ performance.
(2) The actual value delivered to the Group CEO or a Group Executive is subject to the level of achievement against the performance hurdle and NAB’s share price
at the time of vesting.
(3) F or the LTVR allocated in February 2023, the financial services peer group was AMP Limited, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Bank of Queensland Limited,
Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Macquarie Group Limited, Suncorp Group Limited and Westpac Banking Corporation.
A decision in 2023 to change the executive remuneration framework with effect from 1 October 2023 was approved by the Board.
Further information about the change is provided in section 5. Accordingly, the executive remuneration framework illustrated
above ceased to apply on 30 September 2023.

(1) Roles are defined in the NAB Enterprise Agreement 2023. Group 1 - 6 roles are roles below the Group CEO and Group Executives (which are Group 7 roles).
(2) Deferral thresholds and deferral periods are different depending on the incentive plan participated in and the seniority of the colleague.
(3) The grant of shares or cash and value of the award is determined by the Board each year in its discretion.
Enhancements to the colleague remuneration framework
In 2023 we reviewed the colleague remuneration framework to ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements introduced
by CPS 511. The enhancements to the colleague remuneration framework were informed by an independent review of the Group
remuneration framework, performance management framework and consequence management practices completed in June
2022. We continued our focus on embedding simplification and standardisation through a compliant, cost effective and market
aligned approach.
Colleague benefits and initiatives
NAB provides a broad range of benefits including financial and other wellbeing benefits to all colleagues. This includes training
and education such as the CQiB qualifications which more than 14,500 colleagues have completed, data analytics and digitisation
training, flexible work arrangements, up to two days of volunteer leave per year, and wellness and mental health resources
through our Employee Assistance Program.
In 2023 the Group successfully renegotiated the new EA by undertaking extensive negotiations and colleague engagement. The
new EA provides certainty about pay and a range of additional benefits to colleagues including one week of You Leave every
year to eligible colleagues. The FR increase for 2024 for eligible colleagues below Group Executive level is based on colleagues'
current FR as outlined below:
• FR below $110,300: Colleagues will receive a 5% FR increase.
• FR of $110,300 - $140,000: Colleagues will receive a minimum FR increase of 3.5%.
• FR of $140,001 - $185,925: Colleagues will receive a minimum FR increase of 2.5%.
• FR above $185,925: A budget of 3% of FR has been allocated to these colleagues and will be distributed based on individual
performance, internal peer relatives and external market remuneration positioning.
Progress was made on other key colleague initiatives including:
• refinement of our "Ways of Working" to ensure workloads are manageable and colleagues have the support and resources
required to perform their role.

reporting period 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023. The ratio is calculated by dividing the female average salary by the male average salary per employment level. It does not
separately measure the gender pay gap in equivalent roles. Analysis includes permanent, fixed term, and casual colleagues and excludes contractors.

2023 Performance 2023 Annual VR outcomes
and Annual
The Board considered performance across all elements of the scorecard, which reflected another year of good
VR outcomes
results and disciplined execution of strategic initiatives.
The Board determined that a GPI outcome of 90% appropriately reflected the mix of strong and partial
achievements. The GPI outcome reflected good cash earnings, progress on colleague initiatives and safe
growth, partially offset by some non-financial performance measures (see section 3.1). In arriving at this
outcome, the Board considered the sustained improvements in the management of risk and progress against
strategy, customer outcomes and sustainability priorities.
The 2023 Annual VR outcomes were:
Individual Annual VR outcomes
Position % of FR % of Target Opportunity % of Maximum Opportunity
Group CEO 108% 108% 72%
Group Executives 81% – 117% 81% – 117% 54% – 78%
The five-year overview below shows modest Annual VR outcomes when compared to the maximum VR
opportunity available. The level of variation in the outcomes for the Group CEO and Group Executives reflects
appropriate pay for performance alignment.

Section 3 - Our 2023 executive variable reward plans
The 2023 executive remuneration framework (including the executive variable reward plans described below) applied for 2023
and ceased to operate on 30 September 2023. From 1 October 2023, the new executive remuneration framework, as described in
section 5, came into effect for the Group CEO and Group Executives.
3.1 Annual variable reward for 2023
The table below outlines the key features of the 2023 Annual VR plan for the Group CEO and Group Executives.
Feature Description
Purpose Annual VR rewards the Group CEO and Group Executives for delivery of annual goals that drive long-term sustainable
performance. It provides an appropriate level of remuneration that varies based on the Board’s determination of
Group and individual performance over the financial year measured against agreed targets for financial and non-
financial measures that are set to drive delivery of the Group's strategy. The plan is not wholly formulaic. Judgement
is applied through qualitative assessment as determined by the Board.
Annual VR Position Target opportunity Maximum opportunity
opportunity
Group CEO and Group Executives 100% of FR 150% of FR
(excluding Group Chief Risk Officer)
Group Chief Risk Officer 75% of FR 112.5% of FR
Group Group performance is assessed on achievement of financial and non-financial measures (GPI) linked to the Group's
performance key strategic priorities, overlaid by a qualitative assessment. The qualitative assessment may result in the outcome
being adjusted upwards or downwards (including to zero) for risk, quality of performance (including consideration
of financial and customer outcomes, sustainability matters, and progress made against strategy) and any other
matters as determined by the Board. Further detail on the 2023 GPI and outcome is provided in section 4.1.
Individual Individual performance is assessed against a scorecard comprised of key financial and non-financial goals. The
performance weighting of measures reflects the responsibilities for each individual's role. The Group CEO's 2023 scorecard is
and measures aligned to the GPI.

an adjustment to individuals’ performance and VR outcomes:
• Risk: the individual's management of risk and compliance
• Employee conduct: individual performance and VR outcomes may be reduced where expected standards of
conduct are not met
• How We Work: the individual's demonstration of NAB’s values

deferral
Deferred rights are granted in February 2024 and are scheduled to vest pro-rata over four years from grant. Deferred
rights are granted and may vest by the Board at its discretion, subject to the relevant plan rules including malus and
clawback provisions.
A dividend equivalent payment for any vested deferred rights is paid at the end of each deferral period.
Separation If the Group CEO or Group Executive resigns, they will not receive any Annual VR for that year and any unvested
deferred rights will be forfeited.
Unvested awards may be retained on separation in other circumstances prior to the end of the vesting period. The
Board retains discretion to determine a different treatment. Vesting of any unvested awards retained will generally
not be accelerated and will continue to be held by the individual on the same terms.
Board The Board has extensive discretion in respect of the Annual VR awarded. Further detail on governance of Annual VR is
discretion outlined in section 6.2.
(1) All matters relating to the remuneration of Daniel Huggins, Managing Director and CEO BNZ, including scorecard measures and performance assessment, have been
approved by the BNZ Board as required under BNZ's Conditions of Registration which are set by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Daniel Huggins’ Annual VR is calculated
as VR Target Opportunity x (50% Group performance + 50% BNZ performance) x Individual Performance Score. BNZ performance is assessed based on Customer (30%);
Colleagues (12.5%); Safe Growth (7.5%) and Financial (50%). The assessed overall BNZ performance for 2023 was 100%.

3.2 Long-term variable reward allocated in 2023
The table below outlines the key features of the LTVR award allocated in February 2023 for the Group CEO and Group Executives.
From 1 October 2023, the Group CEO and Group Executives will be awarded a Long Term Incentive (LTI) award under the new
executive remuneration framework. The LTI award (comprising the LTEA and LTVR components) will be granted in February 2024
(subject to shareholder approval for the grant to the Group CEO). Further information about the new executive remuneration
framework is provided in section 5.
Feature Description
Purpose LTVR awards were granted by the Board to encourage long-term decision making critical to creating long-
term value for shareholders. They were determined and awarded independently from Annual VR decisions.
Participants Group CEO and Group Executives as determined by the Board.
Award value The maximum face value of the LTVR award was 130% of FR for the Group CEO and Group Executives. The
value of the LTVR granted was determined by the Board. The Board considered the Group's and the relevant
participant's performance when determining the LTVR granted to the participant.
The actual value delivered to each participant is subject to the level of achievement against the
performance measure and may be zero if the performance measure is not achieved.
Instrument The LTVR award was provided as performance rights.
Each performance right entitles its holder to receive one NAB share at the end of the four year
performance period, subject to the performance measure being satisfied.
Allocation approach The number of performance rights granted was calculated by dividing the LTVR award face value by NAB's
weighted average share price over the last five trading days of the financial year. The weighted average
share price used for the 2023 LTVR award, which was allocated on 23 February 2023, was $29.11.
Grant date The LTVR award was granted on 23 February 2023.
Performance period Four years from 15 November 2022 to 15 November 2026.
Performance measure TSR measures the return that a shareholder receives through dividends (and any other distributions)
together with capital gains over a specific period. For the purposes of calculating TSR over the
performance period, the value of the relevant shares on the start date and the end date of the
performance period are based on the volume weighted average price of those shares over the 30 trading
days up to and including the relevant date.
NAB's TSR is measured against the TSR peer group to determine the level of vesting:
NAB's relative TSR outcome Level of vesting
Below 50th percentile 0%
At 50th percentile 50%
Between 50th and 75th percentiles Pro-rata vesting from 50% to 100%
At or above 75th percentile 100%
The TSR peer group is AMP Limited, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Bank of Queensland
Limited, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Macquarie Group Limited,
Suncorp Group Limited and Westpac Banking Corporation. No change was made from the prior year.
Testing TSR outcomes are calculated by an independent provider.
No retesting The performance measure is not retested. Any performance rights that have not vested after the end of
performance period will lapse in December 2026.
Dividends No dividends are paid throughout the vesting period or in respect of vested performance rights.
Separation The treatment of performance rights will depend on the reason for separation:
• Resignation: performance rights will be forfeited in full
• All other circumstances including retrenchment and retirement: the performance rights will be retained
in full unless otherwise determined by the Board in its absolute discretion(1)
Any performance rights a participant continues to hold will remain subject to the performance measure,
with the measure being tested in accordance with the normal timetable.
Board discretion The Board has extensive discretion in respect of the LTVR, including the initial value granted, the amount
of performance rights that vest and any forfeiture or clawback applied. Further detail is provided in
section 6.2.
(1) For example, if the participant retires prior to the end of the financial year in which the performance rights are granted, generally the Board will exercise its
discretion to allow the participant to retain a pro-rata portion of the performance rights reflecting the proportion of the LTVR performance period served when the
retirement occurs.

3.4 Long-term alignment of remuneration
The executive remuneration framework that applied in 2023 incorporated deferral to ensure shareholder alignment and a focus
on continued, sustainable performance. A proportion of remuneration is deferred in the form of equity for up to four years. This
encourages long-term decisions which are critical to creating sustainable value for customers and shareholders. The Board
retains discretion to determine whether all or some variable reward (unvested, vested or paid) may be subject to malus and
clawback. See section 6.2 for more detail.

Section 4 - Remuneration outcomes
4.1 Group performance
The Board determined Group performance for 2023 based on the GPI outlined below. The 2023 GPI was determined as 90%. The
GPI is linked to the Group's key strategic priorities, and has regard to a qualitative assessment of risk, performance (including
consideration of financial, sustainability and customer outcomes, and progress made against strategy) and any other matters as
determined by the Board.
In 2023, when determining the GPI outcome, the Board considered a range of qualitative factors including progress on
sustainability matters. This included progress against sustainability priorities, support for customers (including affordable
housing, cost of living support and scam and fraud prevention), community initiatives, colleague engagement and gender
equality. Further detail on the sustainability matters in our performance and reward framework is provided in section 4.2.

4.2 Group CEO's performance
The table below shows the key 2023 performance measures for the Group CEO and Group Executives and the Board's assessment
of the Group CEO's performance against those measures. The measures were selected to support the Group strategy and are
underpinned by the GPI scorecard in section 4.1. The Board considers that the Group CEO and Group Executives have maintained
momentum in delivering the Group strategy and have delivered strong results against the Group's business plan in a challenging
and competitive economic environment.
Goal, objective and assessment Weighting Outcome
Financial: Deliver attractive returns, safe growth and the financial plan 60% Achieved
Strong financial performance with above plan cash earnings and disciplined management of the
Group's balance sheet. The Group has maintained strong liquidity through 2023 with surpluses above
regulatory requirements.
• Return on Total Allocated Equity (expected loss basis)(1) of 13.15% was 22 basis points higher than plan.
• Cash earnings (expected loss basis)(2) of $7,639 million was $117 million or 1.6% higher than plan.
• Market Share(3) below plan expectations.
• Financial performance / profit growth reflects the continued, disciplined execution of our long-term
strategy targeting growth in higher returning segments while managing the impact of the higher interest
rate environment.
Customers: Deliver a great customer experience and grow customer advocacy 20% Partially
Achieved
Continued support for our customers with a focus on vulnerable customers, customer complaint handling,
customer advocacy and our remediation program. Strategic NPS(4) results were disappointing and below
target in 3 out of 4 priority segments.

• Consumer NPS was 3 points below the baseline of 0, with NAB ranked second among the major
Australian banks(6).
• Business NPS was 10 points above baseline (-4), with NAB ranked second among the major
Australian banks(7).
• High Net Worth and Mass Affluent NPS was 6 points below baseline (-3), with NAB ranked third
among the major Australian banks(8). The HNW NPS segment ended 2023 ranked first among the major
Australian banks.
• Accelerating efforts to protect customers against scams and fraud via customer awareness and
education campaigns, and investing in biometric technologies, machine learning, 24/7 account
monitoring, working with telecommunications companies and delivering pro-active customer alerts.
• Continued improvement to complaints handling and resolution of remediation programs.
• Increased climate and sustainable financing products including the NAB Agri Green Loan, business
finance for “green” equipment and new capability to provide equity funding in innovative early-stage
climate-related investments.
Colleagues: Lead cultural change through energy, positivity, simplicity and engaged colleagues 15% Partially
Achieved
Colleague engagement increased steadily throughout the year achieving an average colleague
engagement score of 77 for 2023, with a Q4 engagement spot score of 78, which was a top quartile
outcome(9). This reflects the work undertaken to realise our desired culture, including simplifying our
processes and prioritising workload management and well-being.
• Continued to embed effective leadership practices across the Group with 92% of leaders having
completed the Distinctive Leadership Program.
• Notable improvement (0.8% increase) in the representation of women in Leadership (Group 4 – 6) roles
was achieved but was slightly below target.
• Implementation of the three-year EA comprehensively supported by the colleague vote.

remuneration outcomes are in accordance with the Group's governance and oversight framework outlined in section 6.1.
Our approach has been consistent since 2020 when the new Group strategy was implemented.
Examples of Sustainability within our performance framework
The list below provides some examples of the types of sustainability related matters that have been incorporated into the
assessments of the Group CEO and Group Executives' performance in 2023. For specific Group Executives, sustainability related
measures are included within their individual performance scorecards.
• Positive customer outcomes: Including NPS measures, meaningful action on customer complaints, appropriate support for
customers experiencing vulnerability, actions taken to build customer awareness and reduce the impact of fraud and scams.
• Positive colleague outcomes: Colleague engagement, gender equality, inclusion and diversity.
• Progress against sustainability priorities:
– Climate change: Progress against existing, and establishing additional, sector decarbonisation targets; building
operational maturity and colleague capability; increasing support for customers through product and service development
and safe growth in environmental financing.
– Affordable and specialist housing: Progress against NAB’s affordable and specialist housing target and development of
NAB’s specialised customer proposition in target growth areas.
– Indigenous economic advancement: Progress against NAB’s Indigenous business strategy including growth of a
specialised banking team, and safe growth in financing to Indigenous businesses.
– Natural disaster support: Maturity of NAB’s customer and colleague disaster support process and national partnerships
implemented to drive meaningful philanthropic activity.
Individual performance modifiers for Risk and How We Work (conduct and values) also consider sustainability related matters, and
therefore may influence final assessed performance.
Further information on NAB’s approach to managing climate change and other sustainability related matters is provided in NAB’s
2023 Climate Report.

Remuneration Report (cont.)
Section 5 - Executive remuneration in 2024
5.1 Our new executive remuneration framework
As foreshadowed in our 2022 Remuneration Report, the Board undertook a detailed review of the remuneration framework for
the Group CEO and Group Executives in 2023. The review was in preparation for the implementation of APRA's Prudential Standard
CPS 511 Remuneration (CPS 511). Based on the review, the Board approved changes to the framework, which took effect from
1 October 2023. The changes meet the requirements of CPS 511 and ensure that the remuneration framework:
• maintains a strong focus on individual performance, conduct and management of financial and non-financial risks;
• drives short and long-term performance, sustainable shareholder growth and a focus on customer outcomes; and
• provides mechanisms to ensure remuneration outcomes will be commensurate with performance and risk outcomes.

Remuneration Report (cont.)
Maximum remuneration opportunity – CEO
The chart below illustrates the reduction in the maximum total remuneration opportunity of the CEO under the 2024 executive
remuneration framework. The reduction is driven by the decrease in Annual VR opportunity offset by an increase to the long-term
VR opportunity reinforcing the importance of decision making, strategic execution and safe, sustainable growth over the long-
term.

New risk management and conduct framework
The 2024 executive remuneration framework continues to focus executives on risk management through annual risk and
conduct assessments. These are undertaken as follows:
VR plan Timing of risk management and conduct assessment:
Annual • At the end of the year when Annual VR outcomes are determined.
VR • At the end of each year during the deferral period before deferred rights are exercised and shares are allocated.
LTI Risk management and conduct assessments are undertaken at four stages:
1. Pre-grant risk and conduct assessment: At the start of the performance year, an individual assessment of each
participant is undertaken to determine the value of performance rights (LTEA and LTVR components) to be awarded to
the participant.
2. Throughout the performance period: Risk and conduct assessments are undertaken throughout the four year
performance period.
3. Prior to vesting of performance rights: At the end of the four year performance period, the LTEA and LTVR performance
measures are tested and an individual risk and conduct pre-vest assessment is undertaken for each participant. This
pre-vest assessment will determine the value of the LTI award (LTEA and LTVR components) that will vest for each individual.
4. Before exercise of vested awards and acquisition of shares: At the end of each year during the deferral period before
vested performance rights are exercised and shares are allocated.
Further information about the risk and conduct assessment mechanisms and the approach to determining remuneration
adjustments is provided in section 6.3.

Remuneration Report (cont.)
5.2 Executive remuneration in 2024
Feature Description
Fixed Remuneration As a result of the changes in the ELT in 2023 and 2024, the Board determined an increase in the FR for
Sharon Cook, Shaun Dooley and Les Matheson to reflect the increase in accountabilities(1) and, Nathan
Goonan and Daniel Huggins to reflect external pay relativity adjustments. The combination of the change
in composition of the Executive Leadership Team and FR increases resulted in FR for the Executive
Leadership Team decreasing by 15% for 2024. Total remuneration (at target) has decreased by 19% for
2024. This reflects the Board's focus on disciplined cost management and maintaining responsible levels of
executive remuneration.
No increase was made to the FR of the Group CEO for 2024.
The FR increase for the following three Group Executives is effective from 1 November 2023, reflecting the
changes to their portfolios.

6.3 Conduct, risk and consequence management
The risk management and conduct framework was reviewed and updated in 2023 to reflect CPS 511 requirements. The review
resulted in:
• Creation of Risk Framework Guiding Principles which guide annual risk and conduct assessments and the application
of consequences.
• A new People & Remuneration Committee and Board Risk and Conduct Assessment Guide which provides steps and factors to
be considered when assessing the nature and type of risk or conduct matter and where required the adjustment criteria to
be applied to VR.
The Committee regularly reviews Group and individual outcomes for risk, reputation, conduct and performance considerations.
This includes oversight of the Group's Employee Conduct Management Framework (Framework) which supports an appropriate
risk culture across the Group. The Board, Group CEO and Group Executives influence culture by focusing on leadership behaviour,
systems and colleagues, reinforced through performance and remuneration outcomes.
How conduct and risk are integrated in our remuneration framework

Consequences may include any combination of coaching, counselling, formal warnings, termination of
employment, impacts to in-year performance assessment, reduction to variable reward outcomes and
the application of malus or clawback
• Quarterly: Risk goals are discussed during quarterly performance check-ins. Conduct matters and risk issues
are discussed as appropriate
• At year end: Leaders undertake a holistic conduct history review and evaluate achievement of the risk goal.
These are translated into the colleague’s performance rating. Remuneration decisions are informed by the
performance rating

Remuneration Report (cont.)
Risk, conduct and the consequence management framework
The Consequence Severity Matrix provides guidance to determine the severity of risk and conduct events. Based on the severity
of the risk or conduct event, a fair and proportionate consequence outcome will be applied. Determination of the appropriate
consequence is guided by an assessment of the quantitative and qualitative impacts of the event including financial impacts,
physical, informational or reputational damage to the organisation and harm to colleagues or customers.

The Group CEO and Group Executives actively demonstrate strong risk management to set the "tone from the top" about
expectations and behaviours. Risk issues that are identified are prioritised, clear accountability is defined, and an action plan
is created to resolve the issue. This has resulted in an improvement in conduct risk, driven by the increased use of analytical
monitoring tools and implementation of assurance capabilities. Enhancements in the use of risk monitoring tools has resulted in
improved identification of risk events and an increase in the number of risk cases investigated relative to 2022.

Remuneration Report (cont.)
7.2 Value of shares and rights
The following table shows the number and value of shares and rights that were granted by NAB and held by the Group CEO and
each Group Executive under NAB's employee equity plans during the year to 30 September 2023. Rights refers to VR deferred
rights, LTVR performance rights and any other deferred rights or performance rights provided under a current or previous VR
plan. A right is a right to receive one NAB share subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance and service conditions.
The grant value shown is the full accounting value to be expensed over the vesting period, which is generally longer than the
current year. The Group CEO and Group Executives did not pay any amounts for rights that vested and were exercised during
2023. There are no amounts unpaid on any of the shares exercised.
There have been no changes to the terms and conditions of these awards, or any other awards since the awards were granted.
All rights that vest are automatically exercised when they vest. For the awards allocated during the year to 30 September 2023,
the maximum number of shares or rights that may vest is shown for the Group CEO and each Group Executive. The maximum value
of the equity awards is the number of shares or rights subject to NAB’s share price at the time of vesting. The minimum number of
shares or rights and the value of the equity awards is zero if the equity is fully forfeited or lapsed.

(1) The following securities have been granted during 2023:
a) LTVR performance rights allocated in February 2023 (in respect of 2022) to the Group CEO and all Group Executives at the time of allocation. The performance rights
are restricted until December 2026 and subject to service and performance measures.
b) Deferred VR rights allocated in February 2023 (in respect of 2022) to the Group CEO and all Group Executives at the time of allocation. The rights vest annually in four
equal tranches between November 2023 and November 2026.
c) Deferred VR shares allocated in November 2022 and February 2023 (in respect of 2022) to Sarah White for her role prior to becoming a KMP.
(2) Calculated using NAB's closing share price on the forfeiture / lapsing date.
(3) The following securities have vested during 2023:
a) Deferred VR rights allocated in February 2022 partially vested in November 2022 for all ELT.
b) Deferred VR shares allocated in February 2019 vested in December 2022 for Sharon Cook, Gary Lennon, Angela Mentis, Rachael Slade and Patrick Wright.
c) Deferred VR shares allocated in February 2020 vested in December 2022 for Nathan Goonan and Sarah White.

(4) Calculated using NAB's closing share price on the vesting date.
7.3 Determining the value of equity remuneration
The number of shares and rights provided to the Group CEO and Group Executives by NAB are determined using a face value
methodology. The table below shows the fair value of shares and rights granted by NAB during 2023 in accordance with statutory
requirements. The grant date fair value of each share is determined by the market value of NAB shares and is generally a five day
weighted average share price. The grant date fair value of shares and rights with market performance measures is determined
using a simulated version of the Black-Scholes model.
No performance options have been granted during the year. Shares and rights granted during 2023 were granted at no cost to
the Group CEO or Group Executive and have a zero exercise price.

Long-Term Variable Reward(5) Performance rights 23 February 2023 29.76 11.65 22 December 2026
(1) The Grant share price is NAB's closing share price at the date of valuation (being the grant date of the relevant award). The Grant share price was used to determine the
fair value for the LTVR performance rights.
(2) Any performance rights that vest are automatically exercised at the end of the restriction period. The end of the restriction period for the performance rights is also
the expiry date for those performance rights.
(3) The number of deferred rights allocated to each eligible participant was calculated using the weighted average share price over the five trading days up to
30 September 2022, inclusive. The deferred rights are split across four equal tranches vesting on 15 November in 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026.
(4) Deferred shares provided to Sarah White relating to the period prior to becoming a KMP.
(5) The number of LTVR performance rights allocated to each eligible participant was calculated using the weighted average share price over the five trading days up to
30 September 2022, inclusive.

Section 8 - Non-executive director remuneration
8.1 Fee policy and pool
Non-executive directors receive fees to recognise their contribution to the work of the Board. Additional fees are paid, where
applicable, for serving on Board Committees, on Boards of controlled entities and internal advisory boards. Fees include NAB’s
compulsory contributions to superannuation. Fees are set to reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the role.
To maintain independence and objectivity, non-executive directors do not receive any performance related remuneration.
Non-executive directors do not receive any termination payments.
The total amount of non-executive directors' remuneration is capped at a maximum aggregate fee pool that is approved by
shareholders. The current aggregate fee pool of $4.5 million per annum was approved by shareholders at NAB's 2008 AGM.
The total Board and Committee fees, including superannuation, paid to non-executive directors in 2023 is within the approved
aggregate fee pool.
The following table shows the 2023 non-executive director Board and Committee fee policy structure.
Non-executive
Chair ($pa) director ($pa)
Board 825,000 240,000
Audit Committee 65,000 32,500
Risk & Compliance Committee 65,000 32,500
People & Remuneration Committee 55,000 27,500
Customer Committee 40,000 20,000
Nomination & Governance Committee - 10,000
8.2 Minimum shareholding policy
To align with shareholder interests, the Board has adopted a policy that within five years of appointment, non-executive
directors must hold ordinary shares equal in value of the annual Chair fee for the Chair and base fee for all other non-
executive directors.
The value of a non-executive director's shareholding is based on the total amount spent to purchase the shares (using the share
price at the time the shares were acquired). Accordingly, the share price at the time of purchase will impact the number of
shares a non-executive director must own to meet the minimum shareholding requirement.
All non-executive directors who have been on the Board for the full year have met their minimum shareholding requirements in
full. Directors appointed during 2023 (Christine Fellowes, Carolyn Kay and Alison Kitchen) will be required to meet the minimum
shareholding requirements by 2028.

9.2 Other transactions
From time to time various KMP and their related parties will hold investments in funds that are either managed, related to or
controlled by the Group. All such transactions with KMP and their related parties are made on terms equivalent to those that
prevail in arm's length transactions.
All other transactions that have occurred with KMP are made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's length
transactions. These transactions generally involve the provision of financial and investment services including services to
eligible international assignees ensuring they are neither financially advantaged nor disadvantaged by their relocation. All such
transactions that have occurred with KMP and their related parties have been trivial or domestic in nature. In this context,
transactions are trivial in nature when they are considered of little or no interest to the users of the Remuneration Report in
making and evaluating decisions about the allocation of scarce resources. Transactions are domestic in nature when they relate
to personal household activities.
9.3 Other equity instrument holdings
In the year ending 30 September 2023, no KMP or their related parties held or transacted any equity instruments (either directly or
indirectly) other than the NAB shares and equity-based compensation disclosed in sections 7 and 8 .
9.4 Other relevant interests
Each KMP or their related parties from time to time invest in various debentures, registered schemes and securities offered by
NAB and certain subsidiaries of NAB. The level of interests held directly and indirectly as at 30 September 2023 were:

There are no contracts, other than those disclosed in table 9.4 immediately above, to which directors are a party, or under
which the directors are entitled to a benefit and that confer the right to call for, or deliver shares in, debentures of, or interests
in, a registered scheme made available by NAB or a related body corporate. All of the directors have disclosed interests in
organisations not related to the Group and are to be regarded as interested in any contract or proposed contract that may be
made between NAB and any such organisations.

Notes to the financial statements
Introduction
Note 1
Basis of preparation
This is the financial report of National Australia Bank Limited (the Company) together with its controlled entities (Group) for the
year ended 30 September 2023. The Company, incorporated and domiciled in Australia, is a for-profit company limited by shares
which are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange.
The directors resolved to authorise the issue of the financial report on 9 November 2023. The directors have the power to amend
and reissue the financial report.
The financial report includes information to the extent the Group considers it material and relevant to the understanding of
users. Disclosed information is considered material and relevant if, for example:
• The dollar amount is significant in size or by nature.
• The Group’s results cannot be understood by users without the specific disclosure.
• The information is important to help users understand the impact of significant changes in the Group’s business during the
financial year, for example, a business acquisition, disposal, or an impairment / write-down.
• The information relates to an aspect of the Group’s operations which is important to its future performance.
• The information is required under legislative requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) or
by the Group’s principal regulators, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian
Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).
Basis of preparation
This general purpose financial report has been prepared by a for-profit company, in accordance with the requirements of
the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and accounting standards and interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards
Board (AASB). Compliance with standards and interpretations issued by the AASB ensures that this financial report complies with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
Amounts are presented in Australian dollars (unless otherwise stated), which is the Company’s functional and presentation
currency. These amounts have been rounded to the nearest million dollars ($m), except where indicated, as allowed by ASIC
Corporations Instrument 2016/191.
Unless otherwise stated, comparative information has been restated for any changes to presentation made in the current year.
Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount in the
Group's income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
To comply with its obligations as an Australian Financial Services Licence holder, the Group includes the separate financial
statements of the Company in this financial report, which is permitted by ASIC Corporations (Parent Entity Financial Statements)
Instrument 2021/195.
Basis of measurement
The financial report has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for:
• Certain assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) measured at fair value through profit or loss, or at fair value
through other comprehensive income.
• Financial assets and liabilities that are otherwise measured on an amortised cost basis but adjusted for changes in fair value
attributable to the risk being hedged in qualifying fair value hedge relationships.
Accounting policies
During the year ended 30 September 2023, the Group revised its accounting treatment of ongoing trail commission payable to
mortgage brokers. The Group has recognised a liability within 'Other liabilities' equal to the present value of expected future trail
commission payments and a corresponding increase in capitalised brokerage costs within 'Loans and advances'. Comparative
information has not been restated.
Except as explained above, the accounting policies and methods of computation applied in this report are consistent with those
applied in the Group's 2022 Annual Report. There were no substantial amendments to Australian Accounting Standards adopted
during the year that have a material impact on the Group.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management have made a number of judgements and assumptions
and applied estimates of future events. Some of these areas include:
• Impairment charges on loans and advances.
• Fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
• Impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets.
• Determination of income tax.
• Provisions for customer-related remediation and other regulatory matters.
Further details of these critical accounting judgements and estimates are provided in the respective notes to the
financial statements.

Other developments
Interest rate benchmark reform
Over the 2023 financial year, the Group has transitioned materially all contracts referencing Interbank Offered Rates (IBOR)
benchmarks subject to cessation at 30 June 2023. Additionally, fallback language continues to be updated for contracts
referencing IBOR benchmarks subject to cessation in 2024.
The Group continues to meet jurisdictional regulatory guidance and national working group timelines to cease referencing
IBOR benchmarks subject to cessation and IBOR benchmarks which have ceased in new transactions, and actively transition
legacy contracts to alternative risk-free rates. The Group continues to manage the risk arising from transition to ensure a low
probability of occurrence and impact to the Group and its customers. Following the cessation of some benchmarks on
31 December 2021 and 30 June 2023, and adoption of fallback rates in contracts with major counterparties (in particular, central
clearing counterparties), there has been a significant reduction in transition risk since 30 September 2022. In particular:
• Following cessation of USD London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) benchmarks on 30 June 2023, the Group’s exposure to
these benchmarks has reduced significantly. As at 30 September 2023, there is an immaterial exposure referencing the
synthetic version of some of the ceased benchmarks. These financial instruments are awaiting the next contractual rate
reset or customers have chosen to not transition for administrative reasons as their financial instruments mature before the
cessation of the relevant synthetic benchmark.
• Financial instruments referencing other ceased IBOR benchmarks are not material.
• Financial instruments referencing IBOR benchmarks subject to a future announced cessation are also not material.
Future accounting developments
AASB 17 Insurance Contracts (AASB 17) will be effective for the Group from 1 October 2023. The expected impact to the Group
from this new accounting standard is limited to the Group’s equity-accounted associate MLC Life. The change in timing of profit
recognition under AASB 17 is expected to result in a decrease in the carrying value of the MLC Life investment (included within
Note 23 Other assets) by approximately $200 million with a corresponding decrease in retained earnings as at 1 October 2023.
Refer to Note 32 Interest in subsidiaries and other entities for further information.
There are no other new standards or amendments to existing standards that are not yet effective which are expected to have a
material impact on the Group’s financial statements.

Notes to the financial statements
Financial performance
Overview
The Group’s reportable segments are unchanged from the 2022 Annual Report.
A description of the operating activities of each reportable segment is provided below:
• Business and Private Banking focuses on NAB's priority small and medium (SME) customer segments. This includes diversified
businesses, as well as specialised Agriculture, Health, Professional Services, Franchisees, Government, Education and
Community service segments along with Private Banking and JBWere.
• Personal Banking provides banking products and services to customers including securing a home loan and managing
personal finances through deposits, credit card or personal loan facilities. Customers are supported through a network
of branches and ATMs, call centres, digital capabilities as well as through proprietary lenders and mortgage brokers. Personal
Banking results include the financial performance of the Citi consumer business, acquired effective 1 June 2022.
• Corporate and Institutional Banking provides a range of products and services including client coverage, corporate finance,
markets, asset servicing, transactional banking and enterprise payments. The division serves its customers across Australia,
the United States, Europe and Asia, with specialised industry relationships and product teams. It includes Bank of New
Zealand's Markets Trading operations.
• New Zealand Banking provides banking and financial services across customer segments in New Zealand. It consists of
Partnership Banking servicing retail, business and private customers; Corporate and Institutional Banking servicing corporate
and institutional customers, and includes Markets Sales operations in New Zealand. New Zealand Banking also includes the
Wealth franchise operating under the ‘Bank of New Zealand’ brand. It excludes the Bank of New Zealand’s Markets Trading
operations. New Zealand Banking results include the financial performance of the New Zealand liquidity management portfolio,
effective 1 October 2022.
• Corporate Functions and Other includes ubank and enabling units that support all businesses including Treasury, Technology
and Enterprise Operations, Digital, Data and Analytics, Support Units and eliminations.
The Group evaluates performance on the basis of cash earnings as it better reflects what is considered to be the underlying
performance of the Group. Cash earnings is a non-IFRS key financial performance measure used by the Group and the
investment community.
Cash earnings is calculated by adjusting statutory net profit from continuing operations for certain non-cash earnings items.
Non-cash earnings items are those items which are considered separately when assessing performance and analysing the
underlying trends in the business. Cash earnings for the year ended 30 September 2023 has been adjusted for hedging and fair
value volatility, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, and certain other items associated with acquisitions, disposals and
business closures. Cash earnings does not purport to represent the cash flows, funding or liquidity position of the Group, nor any
amount represented on a statement of cash flows.
The Group earns the vast majority of its revenue in the form of net interest income, being the difference between interest
earned on financial assets and interest paid on financial liabilities and other financing costs.

Net interest income
Accounting policy
Interest income and expense are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method. The effective
interest method measures the amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability using the effective interest rate. The
effective interest rate discounts the estimated stream of future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the
financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial instrument.
Fees and costs which form an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument (for example, loan
origination fees) are recognised using the effective interest method and recorded in interest income or expense
depending on whether the underlying instrument is a financial asset or liability.
Included in net interest income are interest income and expense on trading assets, hedging instruments and financial
instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Other income
Accounting policy
Categories of other income are measured as follows:
Item Measurement basis
Trading instruments Trading derivatives - Total fair value change (including interest income or expense).
Trading assets - All fair value changes except for interest income or expense, which is
recognised within net interest income.
Hedge ineffectiveness Represents hedge ineffectiveness arising from hedge accounting, which are the fair
value movements (excluding interest income or expense) that do not offset the
hedged risk.
Financial instruments Includes fair value movements on such items, other than interest income or expense
designated at fair value and movements attributable to the Group’s own credit risk.
Dividend revenue Dividend revenue is recognised in the income statement when the Group’s right to
receive the dividend is established.
Lending fees and other Unless included in the effective interest rate, fees and commissions are recognised
fees and commissions on an accruals basis when the service has been provided or on completion of the
underlying transaction. Fees charged for providing ongoing services (for example,
maintaining and administering existing facilities) are recognised as income over the
period the service is provided.
When a third party is involved in providing goods or services to the Group's customer,
the Group assesses whether the nature of the arrangement with its customer is as
a principal or an agent of the third party. When the Group is not acting in a principal
capacity, the income earned by the Group is net of the amounts paid to the third
party provider. The net consideration represents the Group's income for facilitating
the transaction.
Net investment Investment management income is recognised on an accruals basis as the services
management income are provided and is presented net of direct and incremental investment management
expenses incurred in the provision of these services.

Operating expenses
Accounting policy
Operating expenses are recognised as services are provided to the Group, over the period in which an asset is consumed
or once a liability is created.
Amounts received by the Group as a reimbursement for costs incurred are recognised as a reduction of the
related expense.
Annual leave, long service leave and other personnel expenses
Salaries, annual leave and other employee entitlements expected to be paid or settled within 12 months of employees
rendering service are measured at their nominal amounts using remuneration rates that the Group expects to pay when
the liabilities are settled. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonuses when
the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the
employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. All other employee entitlements that are not expected to be paid
or settled within 12 months of the reporting date are measured at the present value of net future cash flows. Employee
entitlements to long service leave are accrued using an actuarial calculation, which includes assumptions regarding
employee departures, leave utilisation and future salary increases.
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic
possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date,
or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits
for voluntary redundancy are recognised as an expense if the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is
probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.
Refer to Note 24 Provisions for balances of provisions for employee entitlements.

Note 6
Income tax
Accounting policy
Income tax expense (or benefit) is the tax payable (or receivable) on the current year's taxable income based on the
applicable tax rate in each jurisdiction, adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Income tax expense
is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other
comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. The tax associated
with these transactions will be recognised in the income statement at the same time as the underlying transaction.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted as at the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised
or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised for temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits if it is
probable that future taxable amounts will arise to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Deferred tax assets are
reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will
be realised.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
assets and current tax liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable
entity, or on different tax entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or to realise
the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
The Company and its wholly owned Australian subsidiaries are part of a tax consolidated group. The Company is the head
entity in the tax consolidated group. The members of the tax consolidated group have entered into tax funding and tax
sharing agreements, which set out the funding obligations of members. Any current tax liabilities / assets and deferred tax
assets from unused tax losses of subsidiaries in the tax consolidated group are recognised by the Company and funded in
line with the tax funding arrangements.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The Group undertakes transactions in the ordinary course of business where the income tax treatment requires the
exercise of judgement. The Group estimates the amount expected to be paid to tax authorities based on its understanding
and interpretation of relevant tax laws. The effect of uncertainty over income tax treatments is reflected in determining
the relevant taxable profit or tax loss, tax bases, unused tax losses and unused tax credits or tax rates. Uncertain tax
positions are presented as current or deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate.

Notes to the financial statements
Financial instruments
Overview
Financial instruments represent the majority of the Group's balance sheet, including loans and advances, deposits, trading
assets and derivatives.
Initial recognition of financial instruments
A financial asset or financial liability is recognised on the balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument. The Group recognises regular way transactions on the trade date.
All financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value. Directly attributable transaction costs are added to or deducted
from the carrying value of the asset or liability on initial recognition, unless the instrument is measured at fair value through profit
or loss, in which case they are recognised in profit or loss.
Classification
Subsequently, financial instruments are measured either at amortised cost or fair value depending on their classification.
Classification of financial assets is driven by the Group's business model for managing the asset and the contractual cash flows
of the asset. The Group uses the following flowchart to determine the appropriate classification for financial assets.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost unless the Group elects to measure the financial liability at
fair value through profit or loss. The Group will elect to measure a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss if such
measurement significantly reduces or eliminates an accounting mismatch.
Refer to the table at the end of this section for a summary of the classification of the Group's financial instruments.

Overview (cont.)
Measurement
Financial instruments measured at amortised cost
Amortised cost is the amount at which a financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal
repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation of transaction costs, premiums or discounts using the effective interest
method, and for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance.
Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive
income are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity. Upon disposal,
the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the
income statement.
Investments in equity instruments that are neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognised by the Group in a
business combination to which AASB 3 Business Combinations applies, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive
income, where an irrevocable election has been made by management. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are
not subsequently transferred to profit or loss. Dividends on such investments are recognised in profit or loss unless the dividend
clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.
Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss
Changes in the fair value of financial assets are recognised in profit or loss.
Where a financial liability is designated at fair value through profit or loss, the movement in fair value attributable to changes in
the Group’s own credit risk is calculated by determining the changes in own credit spreads and is recognised separately in other
comprehensive income.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are contracts whose value is derived from an underlying price, index or other variable, and
include instruments such as swaps, forward rate agreements, futures and options.
All derivatives are recognised initially on the balance sheet at fair value and are subsequently measured at fair value through
profit or loss, except where they are designated as a part of an effective hedge relationship and classified as hedging
derivatives. Derivatives are presented as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
The method of recognising the resulting fair value gain or loss on a derivative depends on whether the derivative is designated
as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Refer to Note 18 Derivatives and hedge accounting.
Derecognition of financial instruments
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers its rights to
receive contractual cash flows from the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a
separate asset or liability.
The Group derecognises a financial liability when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements (and similar lending and borrowing)
The Group executes reverse repurchase agreements where it purchases a security under an agreement to resell that security
at a predetermined price. These securities are not recognised on the balance sheet because the Group does not acquire
the risks and rewards of ownership of the security. Consideration paid for the purchase is accounted for as a reverse
repurchase agreement and classified as a financial asset. Reverse repurchase agreements that are part of a portfolio of
financial instruments managed together for short-term profit taking are measured at fair value through profit or loss and are
included within Note 9 Trading assets. All other reverse repurchase agreements are measured at amortised cost.
The Group also executes repurchase agreements, where it sells a security under an agreement to repurchase that security at
a predetermined price. These securities are not derecognised from the balance sheet because the Group retains substantially
all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the security. Consideration received for the sale is accounted for as a repurchase
agreement and classified as a financial liability. Repurchase agreements that are part of a portfolio of financial instruments
managed together for short-term profit taking are measured at fair value through profit or loss and are included within Note 16
Other financial liabilities. All other repurchase agreements are measured at amortised cost.

Cash and balances with other banks
Accounting policy
Cash and liquid assets, and balances with other banks are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised
cost. For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and liquid assets (including
reverse repurchase agreements and short-term government securities) and amounts due from other banks net of
amounts due to other banks that are highly liquid, readily convertible to known amounts of cash within three months
and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. They are held for the purposes of meeting short-term cash
commitments (rather than for investment or other purposes). Refer to Note 37 Notes to the statement of cash flows for a
detailed reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents.

Accounting policy
Trading assets comprise assets that are classified as held for trading because they are acquired or incurred principally
for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or form part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are
managed together and for which there is evidence of short-term profit taking. Trading assets are measured at fair value
through profit or loss. Trading assets include commodities measured at fair value less cost to sell in accordance with AASB

Debt instruments
Accounting policy
Debt instruments are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income as they are held in a business model
with the objective of both collecting contractual cash flows and realising assets through sale and they have contractual
cash flows which are considered to be solely payments of principal and interest.

contractual cash flow characteristics that are not considered to be solely payments of principal and interest or they have
been designated as such to eliminate or reduce an accounting mismatch.

Loans and advances
Accounting policy
Loans and advances are financial assets for which the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest
and that are held in a business model with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows.
Loans and advances are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the origination of
the loan or advance, which are primarily brokerage and origination fees. Subsequently, loans and advances are measured
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, net of any provision for credit impairment.

Other financial liabilities
Accounting policy
In certain circumstances, the Group applies the fair value measurement option to financial liabilities. This option is applied
where an accounting mismatch is significantly reduced or eliminated by measuring the financial liability at fair value
through profit or loss.
Where liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss, they are initially recognised at fair value, with
transaction costs recognised in the income statement as incurred. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value and
any gains or losses are recognised in the income statement, with the exception of changes in own credit risk which are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

Notes to the financial statements
Note 17
Provision for credit impairment on loans at amortised cost
Accounting policy
The Group applies a three-stage approach to measuring expected credit losses (ECL) for the following categories of
financial assets that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss:
• Debt instruments measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income.
• Loan commitments.
• Financial guarantee contracts.
Exposures are assessed on a collective basis in each stage unless there is sufficient evidence that one or more events
associated with an exposure could have a detrimental impact on estimated future cash flows. Where such evidence exists,
the exposure is assessed on an individual basis.
Stage Measurement basis
Performing - 12-month ECL (Stage 1) The portion of lifetime ECL associated with the probability of default events
occurring within the next 12 months.
Performing - Lifetime ECL (Stage 2) ECL associated with the probability of default events occurring throughout
the life of an instrument.
Non-performing - Lifetime Lifetime ECL, but interest revenue is measured based on the carrying
ECL(Stage 3) amount of the instrument net of the associated ECL.
At each reporting date, the Group assesses the default risk of exposures in comparison to the default risk at initial
recognition, to determine the stage that applies to the associated ECL measurement. If no significant increase in default
risk is observed, the exposure will remain in Stage 1. If the default risk of an exposure has increased significantly since initial
recognition, the exposure will migrate to Stage 2. Should an exposure become non-performing it will migrate to Stage 3.
For this purpose, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue
cost or effort. This includes quantitative and qualitative information and also forward looking analysis.
ECL are derived from probability-weighted estimates of expected loss, and are measured as follows:
• Financial assets that are performing at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls over the expected
life of the financial asset discounted by the effective interest rate. The cash shortfall is the difference between the
cash flows due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive.
• Financial assets that are non-performing at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount
and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted by the effective interest rate.
• Undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to
the Group if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive.
• Financial guarantee contracts: as the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Group
expects to recover.
Credit quality of financial assets
The Group’s internally developed credit rating system utilises historical default data drawn from a number of sources to
assess the potential default risk of lending, or other financial services products, provided to counterparties or customers.
The Group has defined counterparty probabilities of default across retail and non-retail loans and advances, including
performing (pre-default) and non-performing (post-default) rating grades. In assessing for credit impairment of financial
assets under the ECL model, the Group aligns credit impairment with the definition of default prescribed in its Credit Policy
and Procedures.
Assessment of significant increase in credit risk
When determining whether the default risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group considers both
quantitative and qualitative information, including expert credit risk assessment, forward looking information and analysis
based on the Group’s historical default experience.
• For non-retail facilities, internally derived credit ratings, as described above, represent a key determinant of default
risk. The Group assigns each customer a credit rating at initial recognition based on available information. Credit risk is
deemed to have increased significantly if the credit rating has significantly deteriorated at the reporting date, relative
to the credit rating at the date of initial recognition.

Note 17 Provision for credit impairment on loans at amortised cost
(cont.)
• Retail facilities use the number of days past due (DPD) or the relative change in probability of default at an account level,
to determine whether or not there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
• In addition, the Group considers that significant increase in credit risk occurs when a facility is more than 30 DPD.
Definition of default
Default occurs when a loan obligation is contractually 90+ DPD, or when it is considered unlikely that the credit obligation to
the Group will be paid in full without remedial action, such as realisation of security. Exposures which are in default align to
the non-performing exposures definition in APS 220 Credit Risk Management.
Calculation of ECL
• ECL are calculated using three main parameters being probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure
at default (EAD). These parameters are generally derived from internally developed statistical models combined with
historical, current and forward looking information, including macro-economic data.
• For accounting purposes, the 12-month and lifetime PD represent the expected point-in-time probability of a default
over the next 12 months and remaining expected lifetime of the financial instrument, respectively, based on conditions
existing at the balance sheet date and future economic conditions that affect credit risk.
• The LGD represents expected loss conditional on default, taking into account the mitigating effect of collateral, its
expected value when realised and the time value of money.
• The EAD represents the expected exposure at default, taking into account the repayment of principal and interest from
the balance sheet date to the default event together with any expected drawdown of a facility.
• The 12-month ECL is equal to the discounted sum over the next 12-months of monthly PD multiplied by LGD and EAD.
Lifetime ECL is calculated using the discounted sum of monthly PD over the expected remaining life multiplied by LGD
and EAD.
Incorporation of forward looking information
• The Group uses internal subject matter experts from Risk, Economics and customer divisions to consider a range of
relevant forward looking data, including macro-economic forecasts and assumptions, for the determination of general
economic adjustments and any idiosyncratic or targeted portfolio / industry adjustments, to support the calculation
of ECL.
• Forward looking provisions for both general macro-economic adjustments (EA) and more targeted portfolio / industry
forward looking adjustments (FLAs), reflect reasonable and supportable forecasts of potential future conditions that
are not captured within the base ECL calculations.
• Macro-economic factors taken into consideration include (but are not limited to) the cash rate, unemployment rates,
GDP growth rates, inflation and residential and commercial property prices, and require an evaluation of both the
current and forecast direction of the macro-economic cycle.
• Incorporating forward looking information, including macro-economic forecasts, increases the degree of judgement
required to assess how changes in these data points will affect ECL. The methodologies and assumptions, including any
forecasts of future economic conditions, are reviewed regularly.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
Judgement is applied in determining ECL using objective, reasonable and supportable information about current and
forecast economic conditions. Macro-economic variables used in these scenarios include (but are not limited to)
the cash rate, unemployment rates, GDP growth rates, inflation and residential and commercial property prices. When
determining whether the risk of default has increased significantly since initial recognition, both quantitative and
qualitative information is considered, including expert credit assessment, forward looking information and analysis based
on the Group’s historical loss experience.

Impact of movements in gross carrying amount on provision for ECL for the Group
Provision for credit impairment reflects ECL measured using the three-stage approach. The following explains how significant
changes in the gross carrying amount of loans and advances during the 2023 financial year have contributed to the changes in
the provision for credit impairment for the Group under the ECL model.
Overall, the total provision for credit impairment increased by $529 million compared to the balance as at 30 September 2022.
Specific provisions increased by $24 million compared to the balance as at 30 September 2022, mainly due to new and increased
specific provisions in the Business and Private Banking business lending portfolio, partially offset by work-outs for a small number
of larger exposures in the business lending portfolio in Australia and New Zealand.

Note 17 Provision for credit impairment on loans at amortised cost
(cont.)
Collective provisions increased by $505 million compared to the balance as at 30 September 2022, comprised of:
Collective provision performing – 12-months ECL (Stage 1) increased by $81 million as a result of:
• $149 billion of loans and advances that were newly originated or migrated into Stage 1 from Stage 2 or Stage 3 due to credit
quality improvement.
This was partially offset by:
• $120 billion of loans and advances that were repaid, experienced movement in underlying account balances during the period
or migrated from Stage 1 to Stage 2 or Stage 3 due to deterioration in credit quality.
• A decrease in net forward looking provisions.
Collective provision performing – Lifetime ECL (Stage 2) increased by $264 million as a result of:
• $72 billion of loans and advances that were originated and migrated over the year to Stage 2, including the impact of forward
looking economic information applied in the ECL model or migrating into Stage 2 as a result of loans and advances transferred
from Stage 1 or Stage 3.
This was partially offset by:
• $86 billion of loans and advances that migrated to Stage 1 as a result of improved credit quality or into Stage 3 due to
deterioration in credit quality, were repaid or experienced movement in underlying account balances during the period.
• A decrease in net forward looking provisions.
Collective provision non-performing - Lifetime ECL (Stage 3) increased by $160 million as a result of:
• $5 billion of loans and advances that experienced movement in underlying account balances during the period or were
transferred into Stage 3 from Stage 1 and Stage 2 due to credit quality deterioration.
This was partially offset by:
• $4 billion of loans and advances that were repaid or migrated to Stage 1 or Stage 2 due to credit quality improvement or
migrated to individually credit assessed with specific provisions raised.
• A decrease in net forward looking provisions.
ECL scenario analysis
The Group’s ECL measurement is derived from a probability weighted average of three distinct scenarios (base case, upside
and downside) applied across each of the Group’s major loan portfolios, in addition to FLAs for emerging risk at an industry,
geography or segment level. The probability of each scenario is determined by considering relevant macro-economic outlooks
and their likely impact on the Group’s credit portfolio.
The following table shows the key macro-economic variables for the Australian economy used in the base case and downside
scenarios as at 30 September 2023.

House price change (year ended September) 4.1 3.3 3.0 (24.5) (20.3) 5.5
The following table shows the reported total provisions for ECL based on the probability weighting of scenarios, with the

Applying the average provision coverage ratios by stage, if 1% of the Group's Stage 1 gross loans and advances, contingent
liabilities and credit commitments were included as Stage 2 the provision for ECL as at September 2023 would increase by
$111 million (September 2022: $90 million).
Applying the average provision coverage ratios by stage, if 1% of the Group's Stage 2 gross loans and advances, contingent
liabilities and credit commitments were included as Stage 1 the provision for ECL as at September 2023 would decrease by

• The September 2023 provisions for ECL in the 100% base case have decreased since September 2022 primarily due to an
improved economic outlook. This was partially offset by deterioration in asset quality across the Group’s lending portfolio
combined with volume growth and updated methodology in Business and Private Banking.
• The September 2023 provisions for ECL in the 100% downside scenario have increased since September 2022 primarily due
to an increase in the severity of the stress applied in the downside scenario and deterioration in asset quality across the
Group’s lending portfolio combined with volume growth and updated methodology in Business and Private Banking.
• The upside, downside and base case scenario weightings for the Australian portfolio have remained constant compared with

Note 17 Provision for credit impairment on loans at amortised cost
(cont.)
Impact of movements in gross carrying amount on provision for ECL for the Company
Provision for credit impairment reflects ECL measured using the three-stage approach. The following explains how significant
changes in the gross carrying amount of loans and advances during the 2023 financial year have contributed to the changes in
the provision for credit impairment for the Company under the ECL model.
Overall, the total provision for credit impairment increased by $361 million compared to the balance as at 30 September 2022.
Specific provisions increased by $19 million compared to the balance as at 30 September 2022, mainly due to new and increased
specific provisions in the Business and Private Banking business lending portfolio, partially offset by work-outs for a small number
of larger exposures in the Australian business lending portfolio.
Collective provisions increased by $342 million compared to the balance as at 30 September 2022, comprised of:
Collective provision performing – 12-months ECL (Stage 1) increased by $69 million due to:
• $131 billion of loans and advances that were newly originated or migrated into Stage 1 from Stage 2 or Stage 3 due to credit
quality improvement.
This was partially offset by:
• $105 billion of loans and advances that were repaid, experienced movement in underlying account balances during the period
or migrated from Stage 1 to Stage 2 or Stage 3 due to deterioration in credit quality.
• A decrease in net forward looking provisions.
Collective provision performing – Lifetime ECL (Stage 2) increased by $183 million due to:
• $60 billion of loans and advances that were originated and migrated over the year to Stage 2, including the impact of forward
looking economic information applied in the ECL model or migrating into Stage 2 as a result of loans and advances transferred
from Stage 1 or Stage 3.
This was partially offset by:
• $72 billion of loans and advances that were repaid, experienced movement in underlying account balances during the period,
migrated to Stage 1 as a result of improved credit quality or into Stage 3 due to deterioration in credit quality.
• A decrease in net forward looking provisions.
Collective provision non-performing - Lifetime ECL (Stage 3) increased by $90 million due to:
• $4 billion of existing loans and advances that were transferred into Stage 3 from Stage 1 and Stage 2 due to credit quality
deterioration or experienced movement in underlying account balances during the period.
This was partially offset by:
• $3 billion of loan and advances that were repaid, migrated to Stage 1 or Stage 2 due to credit quality improvement or migrated
to individually credit assessed with specific provisions raised.
• A decrease in net forward looking provisions.
Write-offs still under enforcement activity
The contractual amount outstanding on loans and advances that were written off during the 2023 financial year, which are still
subject to enforcement activity was $9 million (2022: $68 million) for the Group and $8 million (2022: $45 million) for the Company.
Information about gross impaired assets
Stage 3 non-performing exposures include both default but not impaired and gross impaired assets. The following table provides
details on gross impaired assets. Gross amounts are shown before taking into account any collateral held or other credit
enhancements. Refer to Note 19 Financial risk management for analysis of the credit quality of the Group’s loans and advances,
including by provision stage.

Accounting policy
Trading derivatives
Trading derivatives are not in a qualifying hedging relationship and are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Hedge accounting
The Group utilises the following types of hedge relationships in managing its exposure to risk. At inception of all hedge relationships the Group documents the relationship between
the hedging instrument and hedged item, the risk being hedged, the Group’s risk management objective and strategy and how effectiveness will be measured throughout the
hedge relationship.

of the hedge. The cumulative movements are expected to be nil by maturity of the hedging instruments.

Risk management strategy for hedge accounting
Overview
The Group’s hedging strategy is to manage its exposure to interest rate risk on a net variable basis in Australian or New Zealand dollars. For Australian and New Zealand denominated
exposures the Group will enter into interest rate swaps where the exposure is to a fixed interest rate. In some instances, cash flow hedges of interest rate risk are also used to arrive at a
net variable rate position. Foreign currency exposures are swapped to Australian or New Zealand dollars using cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The material risks and the risk
management strategy are explained further below.
Cash flow hedges – interest rate risk
The Group manages interest rate risk exposure on deposits and loans via interest rate derivatives. The Group accounts for these hedge relationships as a macro cash flow hedge. The gross
exposures are allocated to time buckets based on expected repricing dates, with interest rate derivatives allocated to hedge accordingly. The benchmark interest rate is hedged which
represents the largest component of changes in fair value and is observable in relevant financial markets.
Cash flow hedges – foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on credit margin cash flows and foreign currency risk on the principal cash flows, both of which arise from foreign currency debt issuances.
The Group uses foreign currency derivatives to manage changes between the foreign currency and Australian and New Zealand dollars for the above mentioned cash flows.
Fair value hedges – interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises on fixed rate bonds, notes and subordinated debt issuances, fixed rate debt instruments held for liquidity purposes and fixed rate loans and advances. The Group
hedges its interest rate risk on these instruments with relevant interest rate derivatives to reduce its exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations.
Hedging relationships are predominantly one-to-one, with the exception of fixed rate housing loans which were previously designated on a macro basis until de-designation in the 2022
financial year.
With all the fair value hedges, the benchmark interest rate is hedged which represents the largest component of changes in fair value and is observable in relevant financial markets.

Notes to the financial statements
Note 18 Derivatives and hedge accounting (cont.)
Hedging derivatives
Hedging derivative assets and liabilities are disclosed by the hedged risk and type of hedge relationship in which they are designated. The Group may designate separate derivatives to
hedge different risk components of one hedged item. In such scenario the notional amount of hedging derivatives will, in sum, exceed the notional amount of the hedged item. In the case of
cross-currency swaps, the Group can designate a single instrument to hedge both interest rate risk in a fair value hedge and currency risk in a cash flow hedge.

Hedged items
The balance of the cash flow hedge reserve, which represents the effective portion of the movements in the hedging instrument, is presented in Note 29 Reserves. The movements in
hedging instruments recognised in other comprehensive income are reported in the Group’s Statement of other comprehensive income. As at 30 September, the amounts recognised in the
cash flow hedge reserve for which hedge accounting is no longer applied is a loss of $11 million (2022: loss of $14 million).
The following table shows the carrying amount of fair value hedged items in hedge relationships, and the accumulated amount of fair value hedge adjustments in these carrying amounts. The
Group does not hedge its entire exposure to a class of financial instruments, therefore the carrying amounts below do not equal the total carrying amounts disclosed in other notes.

(1) The carrying amount of debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income does not include a fair value hedge adjustment as the hedged asset is measured at fair value. The accounting for the hedge relationship results in a transfer
from other comprehensive income to the income statement.
(2) On 1 April 2022, BNZ discontinued portfolio fair value hedge accounting for its housing loans. The carrying amount represents the accumulated unamortised portion of the fair value hedge adjustment which will be amortised to profit or loss over the
remaining term of the loans. The amount that has ceased to be adjusted for hedging gains and losses is a loss of $13 million (2022: loss of $26 million) for the Group and $nil (2022: $nil) for the Company.
(3) The Company does not apply hedge accounting to covered bonds, however these are designated for hedge accounting purposes at the Group level.

Financial risk management
Overview of Risk Management Framework
Risk is the potential for harm and an inherent part of the Group's business. The Group's ability to manage risk effectively is critical
to being a safe and secure bank that can serve customers well and help our communities prosper. The Group's risk management
is in line with APRA Prudential Standard CPS 220 Risk Management.
The Group's Risk Management Framework (RMF) consists of systems, structures, policies, processes and people within the
Group that manage the Group's material risks. The RMF is comprehensively reviewed every three years for appropriateness,
effectiveness and adequacy by an operationally independent party. The Board is ultimately responsible for the Risk Management
Framework and oversees its operation by management. In addition, directors and senior executives are held accountable for the
parts of the Group’s operations they manage or control.
The Group applies a 'Three Lines of Accountability' operating model in relation to the management of risk. The overarching
principle of the model is that risk management capability must be embedded within the business to be effective. The role of each
line is:
• First Line - Businesses own risks and obligations, and the controls and mitigation strategies that help manage them.
• Second Line - A functionally segregated Risk function develops risk management frameworks, defines risk boundaries,
provides objective review and challenge regarding the effectiveness of risk management within the first line businesses,
and executes specific risk management activities where a functional segregation of duties and/or specific risk capability
is required.
• Third Line - An independent Internal Audit function reporting to the Board monitors the end-to-end effectiveness of risk
management and compliance with the RMF.
Further risk management information for the Group is disclosed in the Corporate Governance section of the Group’s website at
nab.com.au/about-us/corporate-governance.
Credit risk
Credit risk overview, management and control responsibilities
Credit is any transaction that creates an actual or potential obligation for a counterparty or a customer to pay the Group. Credit
risk is the potential that a counterparty or customer will fail to meet its obligations to the Group in accordance with the agreed
terms. Lending activities account for most of the Group’s credit risk, however other sources of credit risk also exist throughout
the activities of the Group. These activities include the trading book, and other financial instruments and loans (including, but not
limited to, acceptances, placements, inter-bank transactions, trade financing, foreign exchange transactions, swaps, bonds and
options), as well as in the extension of commitments and guarantees and the settlement of transactions.
The Group structures the levels of credit risk it undertakes by placing limits on the amount of risk accepted in relation to existing
or potential counterparties or customers, groups of related counterparties or groups of related customers, and to geographical
and industry segments. Such risks are monitored on an ongoing basis and are subject to annual or more frequent review.
In general, the Group does not take possession of collateral it holds as security or call on other credit enhancements that would
result in recognition of an asset on the balance sheet.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through regular analysis of the ability of existing or potential counterparties, customers,
groups of related counterparties or groups of related customers to meet repayment obligations, primarily interest and principal,
and by changing credit limits where appropriate. Exposure to credit risk is also managed in part, by obtaining collateral and
corporate and personal guarantees.
The Group further restricts its exposure to credit losses by entering into master netting arrangements for derivatives,
repurchase and securities lending transactions with counterparties with which it undertakes a significant volume of
transactions. The credit risk associated with contracts favourable to a Group entity is reduced by a master netting arrangement
to the extent that if a counterparty failed to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed terms, all contracts with a
counterparty can be terminated and settled on a net basis.
ESG risks
The Group is exposed to ESG and other emerging risks. The following items are examples of how these risks may impact
the Group:
• Increases in the frequency and severity of climatic events could impact customers’ ability to service their loans or the value
of the collateral held to secure the loans.
• Action taken by governments, regulators and society more generally, to transition to a low-carbon economy, could impact
the ability of some customers to generate long-term returns in a sustainable way or lead to certain assets being stranded in
the future.
• Failure to comply with environmental and social legislation (emerging and current) may impact customers’ ability to generate
sustainable returns and service their loans.
• If in future customers don’t hold appropriate levels of insurance for physical assets against certain risks, this may impact the
value the Group can recover in the event of certain natural disasters.
The Group considers these risks as part of the credit risk assessment and due diligence process before relevant customers
are granted credit and for new product development. The Group also manages its total credit portfolio within established risk
appetite and limits, particularly for specific industries or regions that are more exposed to these types of risks. In addition, the
Group may recognise FLAs to the provision for credit impairment for the impact of adverse climate events. In the 2022 financial
year, the Group recognised a FLA of $14 million for the potential impact of the Lismore floods (2023: nil).

Maximum exposure to credit risk
For financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount. In certain
circumstances, there may be differences between the carrying amounts reported on the balance sheet and the amounts
reported in the tables below. Principally, these differences arise in respect of financial assets that are subject to risks other
than credit risk, such as equity instruments which are primarily subject to market risk, or bank notes and coins.
For financial guarantees granted, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount that the Group would have to
pay if the guarantees are called upon. For irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related commitments, the maximum
exposure to credit risk is the full amount of committed facilities.
The table below shows the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions
before taking into account any collateral held or other credit enhancements.

(a) The balance of Cash and liquid assets that is exposed to credit risk is comprised primarily of reverse repurchase
agreements and securities borrowing agreements.
(b) The balance of Due from other banks that is exposed to credit risk is comprised primarily of securities borrowing
agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, as well as balances held with central supervisory banks and other interest
earning assets. Securities borrowing agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are collateralised with highly liquid
securities and the collateral is in excess of the borrowed or loaned amount.
Balances held with central supervisory banks and other interest earning assets that are due from other banks are managed
based on the counterparty’s creditworthiness. The Group will utilise master netting arrangements where possible to reduce
its exposure to credit risk.
(c) The maximum exposure to credit risk from Collateral placed is the collateral placed with the counterparty before
consideration of any netting arrangements.
(d) At any one time, the maximum exposure to credit risk from Trading assets and Derivative assets is limited to the current
fair value of instruments that are favourable to the Group less collateral obtained. This credit risk is managed as part of the
overall lending limits with customers, together with potential exposures from market movements.
The Group uses documentation including International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreements to
document derivative activities. Under ISDA Master Agreements, if a default of a counterparty occurs, all contracts with the
counterparty are terminated. They are then settled on a net basis at market levels current at the time of default. The Group
also executes Credit Support Annexes in conjunction with ISDA Master Agreements.
Credit risk from over-the-counter trading and hedging derivatives is mitigated where possible through netting arrangements
whereby derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty can be offset in certain circumstances. Derivatives that
are cleared through a central clearing counterparty or an exchange have less credit risk than over-the-counter derivatives
and are subject to relevant netting and collateral agreements.
Collateral is obtained against derivative assets, depending on the creditworthiness of the counterparty and / or the nature of
the transaction.
(e) Debt instruments are generally comprised of government, semi-government, corporate and financial institution bonds,
notes and securities. The amount of collateral held against such instruments will depend on the counterparty and the nature
of the specific financial instrument.
The Group may utilise credit default swaps, guarantees provided by central banks, other forms of credit enhancements or
collateral to minimise the Group’s exposure to credit risk.
204 National Australia Bank
Notes to the financial statements
Note 19 Financial risk management (cont.)
(f) Gross loans and advances and Other financial assets primarily comprise general lending and line of credit products. The
distinction is due to accounting classification and measurement. These lending products will generally have a significant level
of collateralisation depending on the nature of the product.
Other lending to non-retail customers may be provided on an unsecured basis or secured (partially or fully) by acceptable
collateral defined in specific Group credit policy and business unit procedures. Collateral is generally comprised of business
assets, inventories and in some cases personal assets of the borrower. The Group manages its exposure to these products
by completing a credit evaluation to assess the customer’s character, industry, business model and capacity to meet their
commitments without distress. Collateral provides a secondary source of repayment for funds advanced in the event that
a customer cannot meet their contractual repayment obligations. For amounts due from customers on acceptances the
Group generally has recourse to guarantees, underlying inventories or other assets in the event of default which significantly
mitigates the credit risk associated with accepting the customer’s credit facility with a third party.
Housing loans are secured against residential property as collateral and, where applicable, Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI)
is obtained by the Group (mostly in Australia) to cover any shortfall in outstanding loan principal and accrued interest. LMI
is generally obtained for residential mortgages with a Loan to Valuation Ratio (LVR) in excess of 80%. The financial effect of
these measures is that remaining credit risk on residential mortgage loans is minimal. Other retail lending products are mostly
unsecured (e.g. credit card outstandings and other personal lending).
(g) The balance of Other assets which is exposed to credit risk includes securities sold not delivered, interest receivable
accruals and other receivables. Interest receivable accruals are subject to the same collateral as the underlying borrowings.
Other receivables will mostly be unsecured. There are typically no collateral or other credit enhancements obtained in
respect of amounts Due from controlled entities.
(h) Bank guarantees and letters of credit are comprised primarily of guarantees to customers, standby or documentary letters
of credit and performance related contingencies. The Group will typically have recourse to specific assets pledged as
collateral in the event of a default by a party for which the Group has guaranteed its obligations to a third party and therefore
tend to carry the same credit risk as loans.
Credit commitments represent binding commitments to extend credit where the Group is potentially exposed to loss of an
amount equal to the total unused commitments. However, the likely amount of loss is generally less than the total unused
commitments, as most commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.
The Group monitors the term to maturity of credit commitments because, in general, longer-term commitments have a
greater degree of credit risk than shorter term commitments.

Offsetting financial assets and liabilities
The tables below present the amounts of financial instruments that have been offset on the balance sheet, as well as those
amounts that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements. The tables exclude financial
instruments that are not subject to offsetting arrangements but are instead only subject to collateral arrangements.
The ‘Net amounts’ presented in the tables are not intended to represent the Group’s actual exposure to credit risk. The Group
utilises a wide range of strategies to mitigate credit risk in addition to netting and collateral arrangements, including placing
limits on the amount of risk accepted in relation to counterparties, customers, groups of related counterparties or customers
and geographical and industry segments.
The amounts recognised on the balance sheet are presented in the 'Total balance sheet amount' column in the tables
below, and comprise the sum of the 'Net amount reported on balance sheet' and 'Amounts not subject to enforceable
netting arrangements'.

Derivative assets and derivative liabilities
Derivative assets and derivative liabilities are only offset on the balance sheet where the Group has a legally enforceable right
to offset in all circumstances and there is an intention to settle the asset and liability on a net basis, or to realise the asset and
settle the liability simultaneously. The Group has applied offsetting to certain centrally cleared derivatives and their associated
collateral amounts which satisfy the AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Presentation requirements.
Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements
Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements will typically be subject to Global Master Repurchase Agreements or similar
agreements whereby all outstanding transactions with the same counterparty can only be offset and closed out upon a default
or insolvency event. In some instances, the agreement provides the Group with a legally enforceable right to offset in all
circumstances. In such a case and where there is an intention to settle the asset and liability on a net basis, or to realise the
asset and settle the liability simultaneously, the amounts with that counterparty are offset on the balance sheet.
Where the Group has a right to offset on default or insolvency only, the related non-cash collateral amounts comprise highly
liquid securities, either obtained or pledged, which can be realised in the event of a default or insolvency by one of the
counterparties. The value of such securities obtained or pledged must at least equate to the value of the exposure to the
counterparty, therefore the net exposure is considered to be nil.
Loans and advances, deposits and other borrowings
The amounts offset for loans and advances and deposits and other borrowings represent amounts subject to set-off
agreements that satisfy the AASB 132 requirements. The 'Net amounts reported on balance sheet' are included within ‘Overdrafts’
in Note 12 Loans and Advances and ‘On-demand and short-term deposits’ and ‘Deposits not bearing interest’ in Note 13 Deposits
and other borrowings. The 'Amounts not subject to enforceable netting arrangements' represent all other loans and advances
and deposits and other borrowings of the Group, including those measured at fair value.

Credit risk exposure by risk grade
The following tables show the credit quality of credit risk exposures to which the expected credit loss model is applied, for both
recognised and unrecognised financial assets, based on the following risk grades:
• Senior investment grade: broadly corresponds with Standard & Poor’s ratings of AAA to A- (internal rating 1 to 5).
• Investment grade: broadly corresponds with Standard & Poor’s ratings of BBB+ to BBB- (internal rating 6 to 11).
• Sub-investment grade: broadly corresponds with Standard & Poor’s ratings of BB+ (internal rating 12 to 23).
• Default: broadly corresponds with Standard & Poor’s rating of D (internal rating 98 and 99).
Notional stage allocations (Stage 1 and Stage 2) for credit risk exposures incorporate the impact of forward looking economic
information applied in the expected credit loss model. Refer Accounting Policy section of Note 17 Provision for credit impairment
on loans at amortised cost for further details.

Concentration of exposure
Concentration of credit risk exists when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar activities, or operate in the same
geographical areas or industry sectors and have similar economic characteristics so that their ability to meet contractual
obligations is similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions.
The diversification and size of the Group is such that its lending is widely spread both geographically and in terms of the types of
industries it serves.

Market risk
Market risk overview and management
Market risk primarily stems from the Group’s trading and balance sheet management activities, the impact of changes and
correlation between interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads and volatility in bond, commodity or equity prices.
Market risk is represented by the below two categories:
Traded Market Risk Non-Traded Market Risk
Traded Market Risk is the potential for gains or losses to arise The Group has exposure to non-traded market risk, primarily
from trading activities undertaken by the Group as a result of Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB). IRRBB is the risk
movements in market prices. The trading activities of the Group that the Group’s earnings or economic value will be affected or
are principally carried out by Corporate and Institutional Banking. reduced by changes in interest rates. The sources of IRRBB are
as follows:
Trading activities represent dealings that encompass both
active management of market risk and supporting client sales • Repricing risk, arising from changes to the overall level of
businesses. The types of market risk arising from these activities interest rates and inherent mismatches in the repricing term
include interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity, equity price, of banking book items.
credit spread and volatility risk. • Yield curve risk, arising from a change in the relative level of
interest rates for different tenors and changes in the slope or
shape of the yield curve.
• Basis risk, arising from differences between the actual and
expected interest margins on banking book items over the
implied cost of funds of those items.
• Optionality risk, arising from the existence of stand-alone or
embedded options in banking book items, to the extent that
the potential for those losses is not included in the above risks.
Measurement of market risk
The Group primarily manages and controls market risk using Value at Risk (VaR), which is a standard measure used throughout the
industry. VaR gauges the Group’s possible loss for the holding period based on historical market movements. VaR is measured
at a 99% confidence interval. This means that there is a 99% chance that the loss will not exceed the VaR estimate during the
holding period.
The Group employs other risk measures to supplement VaR, with appropriate limits to manage and control risks, and
communicate the specific nature of market exposures to management, the Board Risk & Compliance Committee and ultimately
the Board. These supplementary measures include stress testing, stop loss, position and sensitivity limits.

Traded market risk
The VaR methodology involves multiple revaluations of the trading books using 550 days of historical pricing shifts. The pricing data is rolled daily.
The use of VaR methodology has limitations, which include:
• The historical data used to calculate VaR is not always an appropriate proxy for current market conditions. If market volatility or correlation conditions change significantly, losses may
occur more frequently and to a greater magnitude than the VaR measure suggests.
• VaR methodology assumes that positions are held for one day and may underestimate losses on positions that cannot be hedged or reversed inside that timeframe.
• VaR is calculated on positions at the close of each trading day, and does not measure risk on intra-day positions.
• VaR does not describe the directional bias or size of the positions generating the risk.
The table below shows the Group and Company VaR for the trading portfolio, including both physical and derivative positions:

Non-traded market risk - Balance sheet risk management
The principal objective of balance sheet risk management is to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to mitigate the negative impact of movements in interest rates on
the earnings and market value of the Group’s banking book, while ensuring the Group maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations as they fall due.
Non-traded market risk – Interest rate risk management
IRRBB is measured, monitored, and managed from both an internal management and regulatory perspective. The Risk Management Framework incorporates both market valuation and
earnings based approaches in accordance with the IRRBB Policy and Prudential Practice Guides. Risk measurement techniques include VaR, Earnings at Risk (EaR), interest rate risk stress
testing, repricing analysis, cash flow analysis and scenario analysis. The IRRBB regulatory capital calculation incorporates repricing, yield curve, basis, and optionality risk, embedded gains /
losses and any inter-risk and / or inter-currency diversification. The Group has been accredited by APRA to use its internal model for the measurement of IRRBB.
Key features of the internal interest rate risk management model include:
• Historical simulation approach utilising instantaneous interest rate shocks.
• Static balance sheet (i.e. any new business is assumed to be matched, hedged or subject to immediate repricing).
• VaR and EaR are measured on a consistent basis.
• 99% confidence level.
• Three month holding period.
• EaR utilises a 12 month forecast period.
• At least six years of business day historical data (updated daily).
• Investment term for capital is modelled with an established benchmark term of between one and five years.
• Investment term for core non-interest bearing assets and liabilities is modelled on a behavioural basis with a term that is consistent with sound statistical analysis.
The following table shows the Group and the Company aggregate VaR and EaR for the IRRBB:

Residual value risk
As part of its normal lending activities, the Group takes residual value risk on assets such as industrial, mining, rail, aircraft, marine, technology, healthcare and other equipment. This exposes
the Group to a potential fall in prices of these assets below the outstanding residual exposure at the facility expiry.

Notes to the financial statements
Note 19 Financial risk management (cont.)
Liquidity risk and funding mix
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. These obligations include the
repayment of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity, the repayment of wholesale borrowings and loan capital as
they mature and the payment of interest on borrowings.
These risks are governed by the Group’s funding and liquidity risk appetite which is set by the Board. Group Treasury is
responsible for the management of these risks. Objective review and challenge of the effectiveness of risk management is
provided by Group Balance Sheet and Liquidity Risk Management with oversight by the Group Asset and Liability Committee. The
Board has the ultimate responsibility to monitor and review the adequacy of the Group’s funding and liquidity RMF and the Group’s
compliance with risk appetite.
Key principles adopted in the Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk include:
• Monitoring the Group’s liquidity position on a daily basis, using a combination of contractual and behavioural modelling of
balance sheet and cash flow information.
• Maintaining a HQLA portfolio which supports intra-day operations and may be sold in times of market stress.
• Operating a prudent funding strategy which ensures appropriate diversification and limits maturity concentrations. The Group
undertakes a conservative approach by imposing internal limits that are in addition to regulatory requirements.
• Maintaining a contingent funding plan designed to respond to an accelerated outflow of funds from the Group.
• Requiring the Group to have the ability to meet a range of survival horizon scenarios, including name-specific and general
liquidity stress scenarios.
The Group maintained funding and liquidity metrics well above regulatory minimums throughout the 2023 financial year. The CLF
has been fully phased out to zero on 1 January 2023.
The liquid asset portfolio held as part of these principles is well diversified by currency, counterparty and product type with the
mix consistent with the liquidity risks of the Group. The composition of the portfolio includes cash, government securities and
highly rated investment grade paper. The market value of total on-balance sheet liquid assets held as at 30 September 2023
was $222,463 million (2022: $220,415 million). In addition, the Group holds internal RMBS as a source of contingent liquidity. As at
30 September 2023, the cash value of unencumbered internal RMBS held and available was $80,089 million (2022: $66,114 million).
Funding mix
The Group’s funding is comprised of a mix of deposits, term wholesale funding, short-term wholesale funding and equity. The
Group manages this within risk appetite settings to ensure suitable funding of its asset base and to enable it to respond to
changing market conditions and regulatory requirements.
The Group maintains a strong focus on stable deposits both from a growth and quality perspective and continues to utilise
deposits as a key funding source for funded assets.
The Group supplements deposit-raising via its term funding programmes, raising $40,254 million(1) of term wholesale funding in the
2023 financial year (2022: $38,676 million). The weighted average maturity of term wholesale funding issued by the Group was 4.3(2)
years to first call (2022: 5.0(2) years). In addition, during the 2023 financial year, the Group continued to access international and
domestic short-term wholesale markets.
On 19 March 2020, the RBA announced the establishment of the TFF for the Australian banking system to support ADIs in providing
credit into the economy. The TFF provided access to three-year secured funding, supporting lending to the Group's customers
and reducing wholesale funding refinancing risks at the time. The total available TFF allocation of $31,866 million (excluding the
TFF acquired via the Citi consumer business acquisition) was drawn, consisting of $14,270 million of Initial Allowance in the 2020
financial year and $17,596 million of Additional and Supplementary Allowances in the 2021 financial year. As at 30 September
2023, the full Initial Allowance amount has been repaid. The Additional and Supplementary Allowances are due to mature by
30 June 2024.
Contractual maturity of assets and liabilities
The following tables show an analysis of contractual maturities of assets and liabilities at the reporting date. The Group expects
that certain assets and liabilities will be recovered or settled at maturities which are different to their contractual maturities,
including deposits where the Group expects as part of normal banking operations that a large proportion of these balances will
roll over.

Fair value of financial instruments
Accounting policy
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. Where the classification of a financial asset or liability results in it being
measured at fair value, wherever possible, the fair value is determined with reference to the quoted bid or offer price in
the most advantageous active market to which the Group has immediate access. An adjustment for credit risk (CVA) is also
incorporated into the fair value as appropriate as well as an adjustment for funding costs (FVA) related to uncollateralised
over-the-counter derivatives. The fair value measurement technique of each class of instrument is described below.
Instrument Fair value measurement technique
Loans and advances The fair value of loans and advances that are priced based on a variable rate with no
contractual repricing tenor is assumed to equate to the carrying value. The fair value of
all other loans and advances is calculated using discounted cash flow models based on the
maturity of the loans and advances. The discount rates applied are based on interest rates
at the reporting date for similar types of loans and advances, if the loans and advances were
performing at the reporting date.
Deposits and The fair value of deposits and other borrowings that are non-interest bearing or at call,
other borrowings is assumed to equate to the carrying value. The fair value of other deposits and other
borrowings is calculated using discounted cash flow models based on the deposit type
and maturity.
Bonds, notes and The fair values of bonds, notes and subordinated debt and debt issues are calculated based
subordinated debt on a discounted cash flow model using a yield curve appropriate to the remaining maturity of
and debt issues the instruments and appropriate credit spreads, or in some instances are calculated based
on market quoted prices when there is sufficient liquidity in the market.
Derivatives The fair values of trading and hedging derivative assets and liabilities are obtained from
quoted closing market prices at the reporting date, discounted cash flow models or option
pricing models as appropriate.
Trading assets and The fair values of trading assets and debt instruments are based on quoted closing market
debt instruments prices at the reporting date. Where securities are unlisted and quoted market prices are
not available, the Group obtains the fair value by means of discounted cash flows and other
valuation techniques that are commonly used by market participants. These techniques
address factors such as interest rates, credit risk and liquidity.
Equity instruments The fair value of equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income is
estimated on the basis of the actual and forecasted financial position and results of the
underlying assets or net assets taking into consideration their risk profile.
Other fi nancial The fair values of other financial assets and liabilities are based on quoted closing market
assets and liabilities prices and data or valuation techniques, appropriate to the nature and type of the
underlying instrument.
Due to controlled Includes reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements that are classified as
entities and held for trading and measured at fair value through profit and loss. The fair values are based
due from on a discounted cash flow model using an appropriate yield curve.
controlled entities
The carrying amounts of cash and liquid assets, due from and to other banks, other assets, other liabilities and amounts
due from and to controlled entities, approximate their fair value as they are short-term in nature or are receivable or
payable on demand.
Guarantees, letters of credit, performance related contingencies and credit related commitments are generally not sold
or traded and estimated fair values are not readily ascertainable. The fair value of these items are not calculated, as very
few of the commitments extending beyond six months would commit the Group to a predetermined rate of interest, and
the fees attaching to these commitments are the same as those currently charged for similar arrangements.
Fair value for a net open position is the offer price for a financial liability and the bid price for a financial asset, multiplied by
the number of units of the instrument issued or held.
Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the beginning of the reporting period
in which the transfer occurs.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
A significant portion of financial instruments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value.
Where no active market exists for a particular asset or liability, the Group uses a valuation technique to arrive at the fair
value, including the use of transaction prices obtained in recent arm’s length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis,
option pricing models and other valuation techniques, based on market conditions and risks existing at the reporting date.
In doing so, fair value is estimated using a valuation technique that makes maximum use of observable market inputs and
places minimal reliance upon entity-specific inputs.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price (i.e. the fair value
of the consideration given or received) unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other
observable current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging) or based on a
valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets. When such evidence exists, the Group
recognises the difference between the transaction price and the fair value in profit or loss on initial recognition (i.e. on
day one).

Note 20 Fair value of financial instruments (cont.)
Fair value hierarchy
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement is categorised is determined on the basis of the lowest
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
• Level 1 – Financial instruments that have been valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical financial assets
or financial liabilities in active markets. Financial instruments included in this category are Commonwealth of Australia and New
Zealand government bonds, and spot and exchange traded derivatives.
• Level 2 – Financial instruments that have been valued through valuation techniques incorporating inputs other than quoted
prices within Level 1 that are observable for the financial asset or financial liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly
(derived from prices). Financial instruments included in this category are over-the-counter trading and hedging derivatives,
semi-government bonds, financial institution and corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, loans measured at fair
value, and issued bonds, notes and subordinated debt measured at fair value.
• Level 3 – Financial instruments that have been valued through valuation techniques incorporating inputs that are not based
on observable market data. Unobservable inputs are those not readily available in an active market due to market illiquidity or
complexity of the product. Financial instruments included in this category are bespoke trading derivatives, trading derivatives
where the credit valuation adjustment is considered unobservable and significant to the valuation, and certain asset-backed
securities valued using unobservable inputs.
Transfers into and out of Level 3 take place when there are changes to the inputs in the valuation technique. Where inputs are no
longer observable the fair value measurement is transferred into Level 3. Conversely, a measurement is transferred out of Level 3
when inputs become observable.
The Group’s exposure to fair value measurements based in full or in part on unobservable inputs is restricted to a small number
of financial instruments, which comprise an insignificant component of the portfolios in which they belong. As such, a change in
the assumption used to value the instruments as at 30 September 2023 attributable to reasonably possible alternatives would
not have a material effect.
Fair value of financial instruments, carried at amortised cost
The financial assets and financial liabilities listed in the table below are carried at amortised cost. While this is the value at which
the Group expects the assets to be realised and the liabilities to be settled, the table below includes their fair values as at
30 September:

Financial asset transfers
The Group and the Company enter into transactions by which they transfer financial assets to counterparties or to structured entities. Financial assets that do not qualify for derecognition
are typically associated with repurchase agreements, covered bonds and securitisation program agreements. The following table sets out the carrying amount of financial assets that did
not qualify for derecognition and their associated liabilities. Where relevant, the table also sets out the net position of the fair value of financial assets where the counterparty to the
associated liabilities has recourse only to the transferred assets.

Goodwill and other intangible assets
Accounting policy
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of an entity and represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of
the identifiable net assets acquired.
Software costs
External and internal costs that are incurred to acquire or develop software are capitalised and recognised as an
intangible asset. Capitalised software costs and other intangible assets are amortised on a systematic basis once
deployed, using the straight-line method over their expected useful lives which are between three and ten years.
Impairment of intangible assets
Assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested on an annual basis
for impairment, and additionally whenever an indication of impairment exists. Assets that are subject to amortisation are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or its value in use. For assets
that do not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit
(CGU) to which that asset belongs.
Goodwill impairment is assessed for each CGU or group of CGUs that represents the lowest level within the Group at which
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Recoverable amounts of CGUs
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined using either value in use or fair value less costs of disposal. Assumptions
for determining the recoverable amount of each CGU are based on past experience and expectations for the future. Cash
flow projections for value in use are based on the latest management approved forecasts and are then extrapolated using
a constant growth rate for up to a further five years. These forecasts use management estimates to determine income,
expenses, capital expenditure and cash flows for each CGU.
The discount rate used reflects the market determined post-tax discount rate which is adjusted for specific risks relating
to the CGUs and the countries in which they operate. The growth rate applied to extrapolate cash flows beyond the
forecast period are based on forecast assumptions of the CGUs’ long-term performance in their respective markets.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The measurement of goodwill is subject to a number of key judgements and estimates. These include:
• The allocation of goodwill to CGUs on initial recognition.
• The re-allocation of goodwill in the event of disposal or reorganisation.
• The appropriate cash flow forecasts, growth rates and discount rates.
Further details about these items are provided below.

Provisions
Accounting policy
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be
reliably estimated. Provisions are not discounted to the present value of their expected net future cash flows except
where the time value of money is material.
Operational risk event losses
Provisions are recognised for non-lending losses which include losses arising from specific legal actions not directly
related to amounts of principal outstanding for loans and advances, and losses arising from forgeries, fraud and the
correction of operational issues.
Customer-related and payroll remediation
Provisions for customer-related and payroll remediation include provisions for potential refunds and other compensation
to customers, payments to colleagues, as well as associated program costs.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
Provisions are held in respect of a range of future obligations such as employee entitlements, restructuring costs,
customer-related and payroll remediation. The recognition and measurement of some of these provisions involves
significant judgement about the existence of a present obligation, the likely outcome of various future events and the
related estimated future cash flows. If the future events are uncertain or where the outflows cannot be reliably measured
a contingent liability is disclosed, refer to Note 31 Commitments and contingent liabilities.
Payments that are expected to be incurred after more than one year from the reporting date are discounted at a rate
which reflects both current interest rates and the risks specific to that provision.
In relation to customer-related remediation, determining the amount of the provision requires the exercise of significant
judgement. This includes forming a view on a number of different estimates, including the number of impacted
customers, average refund per customer and the associated costs required to complete the remediation activities. The
appropriateness of underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other available
evidence, and adjustments are made to the provision where required.

Note 26
Leases
Accounting policy
At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains,
a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for
consideration. At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone selling prices. For leases
of land and buildings where the Group is the lessee, the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components, and
accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset
is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made
at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and
remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset, less any lease incentives received.
The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured under the cost model and depreciated using the straight-line method
from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is reviewed for impairment
and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that have not been paid at the
commencement date, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate which is based on the Group’s funds
transfer pricing curve. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
It is remeasured when there is a lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease, there is a change
in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the
amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will
exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. The Group does not include extension options in the measurement
of the lease liability until such time that it is reasonably certain that the options will be exercised.
The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases and leases of
low-value assets. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.
When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating
lease. To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all the
risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. Where this is the case, the lease is a finance lease. All
other leases are classified as operating leases.

Contributed equity
In accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), the Company does not have authorised capital and all ordinary shares have
no par value. Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or
options are included within equity. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as determined from time to time
and are entitled to one vote, on a show of hands or on a poll, for each fully paid ordinary share held at shareholders’ meetings.
In the event of a winding-up of the Company, ordinary shareholders rank after all other shareholders and creditors and are fully
entitled to any residual proceeds of liquidation.

Bank of New Zealand preference shares
On 14 June 2023, Bank of New Zealand (BNZ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, issued NZD $375 million of perpetual
preference shares (PPS) that are classified as non-controlling interests to the Group. The balance as at 30 September 2023
represents an AUD equivalent of $341 million of PPS issued and $8 million impact of changes in the exchange rate between AUD
and NZD during the 2023 financial year.
The key terms of the PPS are summarised below:
PPS distributions
Distributions on the PPS are discretionary and non-cumulative. If a PPS distribution is not paid in full within 3 business days of
a distribution payment date, BNZ must not authorise or pay a dividend on its ordinary shares, acquire its ordinary shares or
otherwise undertake a capital reduction in respect of its ordinary shares, until a subsequent PPS distribution is paid in full or
there are no longer any PPS outstanding.
The distribution rate for the PPS is fixed at 7.30% per annum until the first optional redemption date of 14 June 2029. After this date
the distribution rate will be a floating rate, reset quarterly, equal to the New Zealand 3 month bank bill rate plus 3.0%. Scheduled
distribution payment dates are on 14 March, 14 June, 14 September and 14 December each year. Any distributions will comprise a
cash amount and imputation credits.
Redemption
The PPS have no fixed maturity date and will remain on issue indefinitely if not redeemed by BNZ.
BNZ may redeem the PPS on the first optional redemption date of 14 June 2029 or on each quarterly scheduled distribution
payment date thereafter, or at any time if a tax event or regulatory event occurs. Redemption is subject to certain conditions
being met, including obtaining the RBNZ’s approval. Holders of PPS have no right to require that the PPS be redeemed.

Reserves
Accounting policy
Foreign currency translation reserve
Exchange differences arising on translation of the Group’s foreign operations, any offsetting gains or losses on net
investment hedges and any associated tax effect are reflected in the foreign currency translation reserve.
The results and financial position of the Group entities that have a functional currency different from Australian dollars are
translated into Australian dollars as follows:
• Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date.
• Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period.
• All resulting exchange differences are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve.
A cumulative credit balance in this reserve would not normally be regarded as available for payment of dividends until such
gains are realised and recognised in the income statement on sale or disposal of the foreign operation.
Asset revaluation reserve
The asset revaluation reserve is used to record revaluation adjustments on land and buildings. When an asset is sold or
disposed of the related balance in the reserve is transferred directly to retained profits.
Cash flow hedge reserve and cost of hedging reserve
For qualifying hedging instruments, the Group excludes foreign currency basis spreads from hedge designations. Any
change in the fair value of these hedging instruments for changes in cross currency basis spreads is deferred to the cost
of hedging reserve and released to profit or loss either when the hedged exposure affects profit or loss or on a systematic
basis over the life of the hedge. The cumulative movements are expected to be nil by maturity of the hedging instruments.
Equity-based compensation reserve
The equity-based compensation reserve comprises the fair value of shares and rights provided to employees.
Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income reserve
The reserve includes all changes in the fair value of investments in debt instruments that are measured at fair value
through other comprehensive income, other than impairment losses, foreign exchange gains and losses, interest income
and net of any related hedge accounting adjustments. The cumulative amount recognised in the reserve is transferred to
profit or loss when the related asset is derecognised.
Equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income reserve
The Group has made an irrevocable election to measure certain investments in equity instruments that are not held for
trading purposes at fair value through other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of these investments are
recognised in this reserve, while dividends are recognised in profit or loss. The cumulative amount recognised in the
reserve is transferred directly to retained profits when the related asset is derecognised.

Final dividend
On 9 November 2023, the directors determined the following dividend:
Franked
Amount Total amount
per share amount per share
cents $m %
Final dividend determined in respect of the year ended 30 September 2023 84 2,628 100
The 2023 final dividend is payable on 15 December 2023. The DRP discount for the 2023 final dividend is nil. Eligible shareholders
have the ability to participate in the DRP for the 2023 final dividend for up to 5 million NAB ordinary shares per participant. The
financial effect of this dividend has not been brought to account in the financial statements for the year ended 30 September
2023 and will be recognised in subsequent financial reports.
Australian franking credits
The franking credits available to the Company as at 30 September 2023 are estimated to be $768 million (2022: $665 million) after
allowing for Australian tax payable in respect of the current reporting period's profit and the receipt of dividends recognised as a
receivable at reporting date.
The final 2023 dividend will utilise the balance of franking credits available as at 30 September 2023. The Company's franking
account will fluctuate during the year depending on the timing of tax and dividend payments. A surplus franking account balance
is only required as at 30 June each year for the purpose of complying with Australian income tax legislation. Instalment tax
payments made after 30 September 2023 will generate sufficient franking credits to enable the final 2023 dividend to be fully
franked and comply with the income tax legislation.
Franking is not guaranteed. The extent to which future dividends on ordinary shares and distributions on frankable hybrids will be
franked will depend on a number of factors, including capital management activities and the level of profits that will be subject to
tax in Australia.
New Zealand imputation credits
The New Zealand imputation credits available to the Company as at 30 September 2023 are estimated to be NZD $2,273 million
(2022: NZD $232 million). The increase in this balance is due to the NZD $5.0 billion dividend that was paid by BNZ in the 2023
financial year.
The Company is able to attach available New Zealand imputation credits to dividends paid. As a result, New Zealand imputation
credits of NZD $0.15 per share will be attached to the final 2023 dividend payable by the Company. New Zealand imputation credits
are only relevant for shareholders who are required to file New Zealand income tax returns.

Notes to the financial statements
Unrecognised items
Note 31
Commitments and contingent liabilities
Accounting policy
The Group discloses certain items as contingent liabilities, as they are either possible obligations whose existence will be
confirmed only by uncertain future events, or they are present obligations where a transfer of economic resources is not
probable or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the balance sheet but are disclosed
unless an outflow of economic resources is remote.
Commitments
Financial assets are pledged as collateral predominantly under repurchase agreements with other banks. The financial assets
pledged by the Group are strictly for the purpose of providing collateral for the counterparty. These transactions are conducted
under terms that are usual and customary to standard lending and securities borrowing and lending activities, as well as
requirements determined by exchanges where the Group acts as an intermediary. Repurchase agreements that do not qualify
for derecognition are reported in Note 21 Financial asset transfers.
Bank guarantees and letters of credit
The Group provides guarantees in its normal course of business on behalf of its customers. Guarantees written are conditional
commitments issued by the Group to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Guarantees are primarily issued
to support direct financial obligations such as commercial bills or other debt instruments issued by a counterparty. The Group
has four principal types of guarantees:
• Bank guarantees.
• Standby letters of credit.
• Documentary letters of credit.
• Performance-related contingencies.
The Group considers all bank guarantees and letters of credit as “at call” for liquidity management purposes because it has no
control over when the holder might call upon the instrument.

Clearing and settlement obligations
The Group is subject to a commitment in accordance with the rules governing clearing and settlement arrangements contained
in the Australian Payments Network Regulations for the Australian Paper Clearing System, the Bulk Electronic Clearing System, the
Consumer Electronic Clearing System and the High Value Clearing System which could result in a credit risk exposure and loss in
the event of a failure to settle by a member institution. The Group also has a commitment in accordance with the Austraclear
System Regulations and the Continuous Linked Settlement Bank Rules to participate in loss-sharing arrangements in the event
that another financial institution fails to settle.
The Group is a member of various central clearing houses, most notably the London Clearing House (LCH) SwapClear and
RepoClear platforms and the ASX Over-The-Counter Central Counterparty, which enables the Group to centrally clear derivative
and repurchase agreement instruments respectively. As a member of these central clearing houses, the Group is required
to make a default fund contribution. The exposure to risk associated with this commitment is reflected for capital adequacy
purposes in the Group’s Pillar 3 reporting. In the event of a default of another clearing member, the Group could be required to
commit additional funds to the default fund contribution.
Credit-related commitments
Binding credit-related commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer provided that there is no violation
of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses
and may require payment of a fee by the customer. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn
down, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Nevertheless, credit-related
commitments are considered “at call” for liquidity management purposes.

Parent entity guarantees and undertakings
The Company has provided the following guarantees and undertakings relating to entities in the Group. These guarantees and
undertakings are not included in previous tables in this note:
• The Company will guarantee up to $30,881 million (2022: $29,023 million) of commercial paper issuances by National Australia
Funding (Delaware) Inc. Commercial paper of $419 million (2022: $1,196 million) has been issued.
• The Company is responsible to its customers for any direct loss suffered as a result of National Nominees Limited failing to
perform its obligations to the Company.
• The Company and MLC Wealth had both been granted a licence (the Licence) in 2007 by the Safety, Rehabilitation and
Compensation Commission (the Commission) to operate as self-insurers under the Commonwealth Government Comcare
Scheme (the Commonwealth Scheme). The Company still holds its Licence and continues to be self-insured under the
Commonwealth Scheme. Following the sale of MLC Wealth to Insignia Financial Ltd (formerly IOOF) in 2021, the Commission
agreed to revoke MLC Wealth’s Licence effective from the date of the sale. As required by legislation and the Commission, the
Company has provided a guarantee in respect of any workers' compensation liabilities of employees of MLC Wealth in respect
of injuries that arose before the completion of the sale.
• The Company has issued letters of support in respect of certain subsidiaries and associates in the normal course of business.
The letters recognise that the Company has a responsibility to ensure that those subsidiaries and associates continue to
meet their obligations.
Contingent liabilities
The Group is exposed to contingent risks and liabilities arising from the conduct of its business including:
• Actual and potential disputes, claims and legal proceedings.
• Investigations into past conduct, including actual and potential regulatory breaches carried out by regulatory authorities on
either an industry-wide or Group-specific basis.
• Internal investigations and reviews into past conduct, including actual and potential regulatory breaches, carried out by or on
behalf of the Group.
• Contracts that involve giving contingent commitments such as warranties, indemnities or guarantees.
There are contingent liabilities in respect of all such matters. Such matters are often highly complex and uncertain. Where
appropriate, provisions have been made. The aggregate potential liability of the Group in relation to these matters cannot be
accurately assessed.
Further details on some specific contingent liabilities that may impact the Group are set out below.
Legal proceedings
United Kingdom matters
Nine separate claims (comprising 904 individual claimants) focused on Tailored Business Loans (TBLs) have been commenced
against the Company and Clydesdale Bank Plc, now owned by Virgin Money UK Plc and trading as Virgin Money (Virgin Money) by
former customers of Virgin Money, represented by RGL Management Limited (a claims management company) (RGL) and law firm
Fladgate LLP, in the English Courts. The cases involving four individual claimants (being the first and fourth claims) proceeded to a
12 week trial which commenced on 2 October 2023, effectively as test cases. The cases of the remaining individual claimants are
currently stayed pending the outcome of the first and fourth claims.
The claims concern TBLs which customers entered into with Virgin Money and in respect of which NAB employees performed
various functions. The claimants allege they were misled about: (1) the cost of repaying (or restructuring) their TBLs early; and (2)
the composition of fixed interest rates/other rates offered under the TBLs. The alleged misconduct is said to give rise to several
causes of action, including negligent misstatement, misrepresentation and deceit.
The potential outcome and total costs associated with the claims remain uncertain.

Walton Construction Group class action
In January 2022, a class action complaint was filed in the Federal Court by a number of subcontractors regarding the Company's
alleged conduct in connection with the collapse of the Walton Construction Group (WCG). It is alleged that the Company's
conduct in the period prior to the collapse of WCG contributed to losses incurred by subcontractors following the liquidation
of WCG. The Company filed and served its defence to the claims on 16 December 2022, however, the Applicant is seeking to
file a second Further Amended Statement of Claim (FASC) and has been given until 7 February 2024 to provide a draft FASC. The
potential outcome and total costs associated with the claims under this class action remain uncertain.
Regulatory activity, compliance investigations and associated proceedings
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing program uplift and compliance issues
The Group continues to enhance its systems and processes to comply with AML and CTF requirements. The Group continues to
keep AUSTRAC informed of its progress. In addition to an ongoing general uplift in capability, the Group is remediating specific
known compliance issues and weaknesses. The Group has reported a number of compliance issues to relevant regulators,
including in relation to ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) requirements (particularly with enhanced customer due diligence for non-
individual customers), systems and process issues that impacted some aspects of transaction monitoring and reporting, and
other financial crime risks. As this work progresses, further compliance issues may be identified and reported to AUSTRAC or
equivalent foreign regulators, and additional uplifting and strengthening may be required.
On 29 April 2022, the Company entered into an enforceable undertaking (EU) with AUSTRAC to address AUSTRAC’s concerns with
the Group’s compliance with certain AML and CTF requirements. In accepting the EU, AUSTRAC stated that the regulator had
“formed the view at the start of the investigation that a civil penalty proceeding was not appropriate at that time” and that it had
“not identified any information during the investigation to change that view”. Under the terms of the EU, the Company and certain
subsidiaries are required to:
• Complete a Remedial Action Plan (RAP) approved by AUSTRAC.
• Address to AUSTRAC’s satisfaction any deficiencies or concerns with activities in the RAP identified by AUSTRAC.
Whilst the Company has delivered the approved RAP and approximately three quarters of the required deliverables, the total
costs of the above remains uncertain and the conclusion or otherwise of the EU will be determined by AUSTRAC.
Banking matters
A number of reviews into banking-related matters are being carried on across the Group, both internally and in some cases by
regulatory authorities, including matters regarding:
• Incorrect fees being applied in connection with certain products.
• Incorrect interest rates being applied in relation to certain products, including home lending products on conversion from
interest only to principal.
• Capturing customer consent to receive electronic statements and inconsistencies with recording statement preferences.
• Issues with treatment of deregistered companies identified in the customer base.
The potential outcome and total costs associated with these matters remains uncertain.
Employment matters
In December 2019, NAB announced an end-to-end payroll review examining internal pay processes and compliance with pay
related obligations under Australian employment laws. The review identified a range of issues, which have been notified to the
Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO). A remediation program was undertaken, which is now largely complete save for some discrete
residual matters still being addressed. There remains some potential for further developments regarding this matter, including
possible enforcement action by the FWO or other legal actions, so the final outcome and total costs associated with this matter
remain uncertain.
In March 2023, the Finance Sector Union (FSU) filed proceedings against NAB and MLC Wealth Ltd in the Federal Court alleging that
those parties had breached provisions of the Fair Work Act which prohibit an employer from requesting or requiring an employee
to work unreasonable additional hours. The claim relates to four current and former employees. The FSU is seeking declarations
that NAB and MLC Wealth Ltd breached the Fair Work Act, the imposition of penalties in respect of the alleged breaches, as well
as compensation for loss and damage to the four named current and former employees and the payment of legal costs. The final
outcome and total costs associated with this matter remain uncertain.
Wealth - Advice review
In October 2015, the Group began contacting certain groups of customers where there was a concern that they may have
received non-compliant financial advice since 2009 to: (a) assess the appropriateness of that advice; and (b) identify whether
customers had suffered loss as a result of non-compliant advice that would warrant compensation. Subsequent to this, these
cases are now progressing through the Customer Response Initiative review program, the scope of which includes the advice
businesses of MLC Advice, NAB Advice Partnerships and JBWere, with compensation offered and paid in a number of cases(1).
Where customer compensation is able to be reliably estimated, provisions have been recognised. The final outcome and total
costs associated with this work remain uncertain.
(1) While the businesses of MLC Advice and NAB Advice Partnerships relevant to these matters have been sold to Insignia Financial Ltd (formerly known as IOOF) pursuant to
the MLC Wealth Transaction, the Group has retained the companies that operated the advice business, such that the Group has retained all liabilities associated with
the conduct of these businesses pre-completion of the MLC Wealth Transaction. JBWere is not within the scope of the MLC Wealth Transaction.

Wealth - Adviser service fees
The Group is undertaking a remediation program in relation to financial advice fees paid by customers pursuant to ongoing
service arrangements. This matter relates to JBWere and the various advice businesses, which were operated by the Group prior
to completion of the MLC Wealth Transaction discussed below, including MLC Advice (formerly known as NAB Financial Planning)
and NAB Advice Partnerships.(1) Payments with respect to MLC Advice are now complete. Payments with respect to NAB Advice
Partnerships are largely complete.
JBWere has identified its potentially impacted customers and has commenced making remediation payments where appropriate.
JBWere continues to assess further matters which may impact clients including clients who are members of an APRA regulated
superannuation fund and their treatment as a wholesale client instead of retail.
While the Group has taken provisions in relation to these matters based on current information, there remains the potential for
further developments and the potential outcomes and total costs associated with these matters remains uncertain.
Contractual commitments
BNZ Life transaction
On 30 September 2022, National Wealth Management International Holdings Limited (NWMIH), a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, completed the sale of BNZ Life to Partners Life. Under the sale agreements, NWMIH has provided certain warranties
and indemnities in favour of Partners Life, a breach of which may result in NWMIH or the Company (as a guarantor to NWMIH under
the terms of the sale) being liable to Partners Life. NWMIH has novated its obligations under the sale agreements, including with
regards to the warranties and indemnities in favour of Partners Life, to the Company. The potential outcome and total costs
associated with this transaction remain uncertain.
MLC Life insurance transaction
In connection with the sale of 80% of MLC Life to Nippon Life Insurance Company (Nippon Life) in October 2016, the Company
gave certain covenants, warranties and indemnities in favour of Nippon Life and MLC Life. The claims periods for some of these
covenants, warranties and indemnities have expired. The potential outcome and total costs associated with any claims under
these covenants, warranties and indemnities remain uncertain.
MLC Wealth Transaction
On 31 May 2021, the Group completed the sale of MLC Wealth, comprising its advice, platforms, superannuation and investments,
and asset management businesses to Insignia Financial. As part of the MLC Wealth Transaction, the Company has provided
Insignia Financial with indemnities relating to certain pre-completion matters, including:
• A remediation program relating to workplace superannuation (including matters where some employer superannuation plans
and member entitlements were not correctly set up in the administration systems, and matters relating to disclosure and
administration of certain features of the super product such as insurance and fees).
• Breaches of anti-money laundering laws and regulations.
• Regulatory fines and penalties.
• Certain litigation and regulatory investigations (including the NULIS and MLCN class actions described below).
The Company also provided covenants and warranties in favour of Insignia Financial. A breach or triggering of these contractual
protections may result in the Company being liable to Insignia Financial. The claims periods for some of these covenants,
warranties and indemnities have expired.
As part of the MLC Wealth Transaction, the Group retained the companies that operated the advice business, such that the
Group has retained all liabilities associated with the conduct of that business pre-completion.
The Company has also agreed to provide Insignia Financial with certain transitional services and continuing access to records,
as well as support for data migration activities. The Company may be liable to Insignia Financial if it fails to perform its obligations
under these agreements.
The final financial impact associated with the MLC Wealth Transaction remains uncertain and subject to finalisation of the
completion accounts process and other contingencies as outlined above.
NULIS and MLCN - class actions
In October 2019, litigation funder Omni Bridgeway (formerly IMF Bentham) and William Roberts Lawyers commenced a class action
against NULIS Nominees (Australia) Limited (NULIS) alleging breaches of NULIS’s trustee obligations to act in the best interests
of the former members of The Universal Super Scheme in deciding to maintain grandfathered commissions on their transfer
into the MLC Super Fund on 1 July 2016. NULIS filed its first defence in the proceeding in February 2020. An initial trial to make
determinations on the individual claims of the applicant and one sample group member was held on 9 October 2023. Judgment
has been reserved.
In January 2020, Maurice Blackburn commenced a class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria against NULIS and MLC Nominees
Pty Ltd (MLCN) alleging breaches of NULIS's trustee obligations in connection with the speed with which NULIS and MLCN effected
transfers of members’ accrued default amounts to the MySuper product (Supreme Court Class Action). NULIS and MLCN filed their
joint defence in the proceeding in April 2020.
(1) While the businesses of MLC Advice and NAB Advice Partnerships relevant to these matters have been sold to Insignia Financial Ltd (formerly known as IOOF) pursuant to
the MLC Wealth Transaction, the Group has retained the companies that operated the advice business, such that the Group has retained all liabilities associated with
the conduct of these businesses pre-completion of the MLC Wealth Transaction. JBWere is not within the scope of the MLC Wealth Transaction.

Notes to the financial statements
Note 31 Commitments and contingent liabilities (cont.)
The potential outcomes and total costs associated with these matters remains uncertain. While NULIS and MLCN are no longer
part of the Group following completion of the MLC Wealth Transaction, the Company remains liable for the costs associated with,
and retains conduct of, these matters pursuant to the terms of the MLC Wealth Transaction.
Note 32
Interest in subsidiaries and other entities
Accounting policy
Investments in controlled entities
Controlled entities are all those entities (including structured entities) to which the Company is exposed, or has rights,
to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power
over the entity. An assessment of control is performed on an ongoing basis. Entities are consolidated from the date on
which control is obtained by the Group. Entities are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The effects of
transactions between entities within the Group are eliminated in full upon consolidation.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate
in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control of those policies. The
Group's investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method, with the carrying amount of the investment
increased or decreased to recognise the Group's share of the profit or loss of the investee.
Structured entities
A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in
deciding who controls the entity. Structured entities generally have restricted activities and a narrow and well-defined
objective which is created through contractual arrangement. Depending on the Group's power over the relevant activities
of the structured entity and its exposure to and ability to influence its own returns, it may or may not consolidate
the entity.
Unconsolidated structured entities refer to all structured entities that are not controlled by the Group. The Group
enters into transactions with unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate customer
transactions or for specific investment opportunities.
Interests in unconsolidated structured entities include, but are not limited to, debt and equity investments, guarantees,
liquidity arrangements, commitments, fees from investment structures, and derivative instruments that expose the Group
to the risks of the unconsolidated structured entities. Interests do not include plain vanilla derivatives (e.g. interest rate
swaps and cross currency swaps) and positions where the Group:
• Creates rather than absorbs variability of the unconsolidated structured entity.
• Provides administrative, trustee or other services as agent to third party managed structured entities.
Involvement is considered on a case by case basis, taking into account the nature of the structured entity’s activities. This
excludes involvement that exists only because of typical customer-supplier relationships.
(a) Investments in controlled entities
The following table presents the material controlled entities as at 30 September 2023:
Incorporated /
Entity name Ownership % formed in
National Equities Limited 100 Australia
National Australia Group (NZ) Limited 100 New Zealand
Bank of New Zealand 100 New Zealand
Significant restrictions
Subsidiary companies that are subject to prudential regulation are required to maintain minimum capital and other regulatory
requirements that may restrict the ability of these entities to make distributions of cash or other assets to the parent company.
These restrictions are managed in accordance with the Group’s normal risk management policies set out in Note 19 Financial risk
management and capital adequacy requirements in Note 36 Capital adequacy.

The Group’s investments in associates include a 20% interest in MLC Life, a provider of life insurance products in Australia. Set out
below is the summarised financial information of MLC Life based on its financial information (and not the Group’s 20% share of
those amounts) and a reconciliation of that information to the equity-accounted carrying amount as at 30 September:

There was no dividend received from MLC Life during the 2023 financial year (2022: $nil).
Impact of AASB 17 Insurance Contracts
AASB 17 will be effective for the Group from 1 October 2023. AASB 17 will change the timing of profit recognition from insurance
contracts. In general, profits will be recognised later than under the current accounting standard.
On transition to AASB 17 the value of MLC Life’s insurance and reinsurance contract liabilities, net of insurance and reinsurance
contract assets, is expected to increase by approximately $1.5 billion, before associated tax impacts. As a result, the carrying
value of the Group's investment in MLC Life is expected to reduce by approximately $200 million with a corresponding decrease in
retained earnings as at 1 October 2023.
Significant restrictions
Assets in a statutory fund of MLC Life can only be used to meet the liabilities and expenses of that fund, to acquire investments
to further the business of that fund, or to make profit distributions when solvency and capital adequacy requirements of the
Life Insurance Act 1995 (Cth) are met. This may impact MLC Life's ability to transfer funds to the Group in the form of dividends. In
addition, in certain circumstances the payment of dividends may require approval by APRA.
Transactions
As part of a long-term commercial arrangement with Nippon Life and MLC Life, the Group refers certain bank customers to MLC
Life. Under a financial services agreement and certain linked arrangements, the Group provides MLC Life with certain financial
services on an arm’s length basis, including custody, transactional banking facilities, fixed income and currency services.

Notes to the financial statements
Note 32 Interest in subsidiaries and other entities (cont.)
(c) Consolidated structured entities
The Group has interests in the following types of consolidated structured entities:
Type Details
Securitisation The Group engages in securitisation activities for funding, liquidity and capital management purposes.
The Group principally packages and sells residential mortgage loans as securities to investors through a
series of bankruptcy remote securitisation vehicles. The Group is entitled to any residual income after
all payments to investors and costs related to the program have been met. The note holders only have
recourse to the pool of assets. The Group is considered to hold the majority of the residual risks and
benefits of the vehicles. All relevant financial assets continue to be held on the Group balance sheet, and a
liability is recognised for the proceeds of the funding transaction.
The Group provides liquidity facilities to the securitisation vehicles. These facilities can only be drawn to
manage the timing mismatch of cash inflows from securitised loans and cash outflows due to investors.
The Group also provides redraw facilities to certain securitisation vehicles to manage the timing mismatch
of principal collections from securitised loans and cash outflows in respect of customer redraws. The
aggregate limit of these liquidity and redraw facilities as at 30 September 2023 is $1,364 million.
Covered bonds The Group is entitled to any residual income after all payments due to covered bonds investors and costs
related to the program have been met. Residential mortgage loans are assigned to a bankruptcy remote
structured entity, which provides guarantees on the payments to covered bondholders. The covered
bondholders have recourse to the Group and, following certain trigger events including payment default,
the covered pool assets.
(d) Unconsolidated structured entities
The Group has interests in the following types of unconsolidated structured entities:
Type Details
Securitisation The Group engages with third party (client) securitisation vehicles by providing warehouse facilities, liquidity
support and derivatives. The Group invests in residential mortgage and asset-backed securities.
Other financing The Group provides tailored lending to limited recourse single purpose vehicles which are established to
facilitate asset financing for clients. The assets are pledged as collateral to the Group. The Group engages
in raising finance for leasing assets such as aircraft, trains, shipping vessels and other infrastructure
assets. The Group may act as a lender, arranger or derivative counterparty to these vehicles.
Other financing transactions are generally senior, secured self-liquidating facilities in compliance with
Group credit lending policies. Regular credit and financial reviews of the borrowers are conducted to ensure
collateral is sufficient to support the Group’s maximum exposures.
Investment funds The Group has direct interests in unconsolidated investment funds. The Group’s interests include holding
units and receiving fees for services. The Group’s interest in unconsolidated investment funds is immaterial.

Total maximum exposure to loss in
unconsolidated structured entities 33,855 37,622 2,626 3,253 36,481 40,875
Exposure to loss is managed as part of the Group's RMF. The Group’s maximum exposure to loss is the total of its on-balance
sheet positions and its off-balance sheet arrangements, being loan commitments, financial guarantees, and liquidity support.
Consequently, the Group has presented these measures rather than the total assets of the unconsolidated structured entities.
Refer to Note 19 Financial risk management for further details. Income earned from interests in unconsolidated structured
entities primarily results from interest income, mark-to-market movements and fees and commissions.
The majority of the Group’s exposures are senior investment grade, but in some limited cases, the Group may be required to
absorb losses from unconsolidated structured entities before other parties because the Group’s interests are subordinated
to others in the ownership structure. The table below shows the credit quality of the Group’s exposures in unconsolidated
structured entities:

Note 33
Related party disclosures
The Group provides a range of services to related parties including the provision of banking facilities and standby financing
arrangements. Other dealings include granting loans and accepting deposits, and the provision of finance. These transactions
are normally entered into on terms equivalent to those that prevail on an arm’s length basis in the ordinary course of business.
Other transactions with controlled entities may involve leases of properties, plant and equipment, provision of data processing
services or access to intellectual or other intangible property rights. Charges for these transactions are normally on an arm’s
length basis and are otherwise on the basis of equitable rates agreed between the parties. The Company also provides
various administrative services to the Group, which may include accounting, secretarial and legal. Fees may be charged for
these services.
Loans made to subsidiaries are generally entered into on terms equivalent to those that prevail on an arm’s length basis, except
that there are often no fixed repayment terms for the settlement of loans between parties. Outstanding balances are unsecured
and are repayable in cash.
The Company may incur costs on behalf of controlled entities in respect of customer-related remediation, regulatory activity,
compliance investigations and associated proceedings. Refer to Note 31 Commitments and contingent liabilities for further
details in respect of these matters.

Loans to KMP and their related parties
During the 2023 financial year, loans made to KMP and other related parties of the Group and Company were $21 million (2022:
$13 million). Loans to non-executive directors of the Company are made in the ordinary course of business on terms equivalent
to those that prevail in arm's length transactions. Loans to the Group CEO and Group Executives may be made on similar terms
and conditions generally available to other employees of the Group. Loans may be secured or unsecured depending on the
nature of the lending product advanced. As at 30 September 2023, the total loan balances outstanding were $59 million (2022:
$47 million).
No amounts were written off in respect of any loans made to directors or other KMP of the Group and Company during the
current or prior reporting period.
Further details regarding loans advanced to KMP of the Group and Company are included in the Remuneration Report within the
Report of the Directors.
86 400 Transfer of banking business
On 8 December 2021, 86 400 transferred approximately $1,286 million of its banking related mortgage assets and $663 million of its
banking related deposit liabilities to the Company on an arms-length basis under the Financial Sector (Transfer and Restructure)
Act 1999 (Cth) (FSTRA). In addition, 86 400 transferred approximately $285 million of its fixed income securities portfolio, held for
liquidity purposes, to the Company on an arm’s length basis under the FSTRA. These fixed income securities were previously
measured at amortised cost as they were managed within a ‘hold to collect’ business model. Following the transfer to the
Company, these securities were reclassified to fair value through profit or loss as the revised business model is neither ‘hold to
collect’ nor ‘hold to collect and sell’. The difference between the previous amortised cost of these assets and their fair value
at the reclassification date was not material. Following these transfers 86 400 surrendered its ADI Licence to APRA and returned
approximately $144 million of share capital to the Company. On a prospective basis, 86 400 will perform various technology and
operational services to support and grow the Company's digital banking activities and business.

Equity-based plans
Accounting policy
The value of shares and rights provided to employees are measured by reference to their grant date fair value. The grant date fair value of each share is determined by the market
value of NAB shares and is generally a five-day weighted average share price. The grant date fair value of shares and rights with market performance hurdles is determined using a
simulated version of the Black-Scholes model.
With the exception of general employee shares in Australia, the expense for each tranche of shares or rights granted is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis,
adjusted for forfeitures, over the vesting period for the shares or rights. The expense for general employee shares in Australia is recognised in the income statement in the year the
shares are granted as they are not subject to forfeiture. A corresponding increase is recorded in the equity-based compensation reserve.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The key estimates and inputs used in the Black-Scholes model vary depending on the award and type of security granted. They include the NAB share price at the time of the grant,
exercise price of the rights (which is nil), the expected volatility of NAB’s share price, the risk-free interest rate and the expected dividend yield on NAB shares for the life of the rights.
When estimating expected volatility, historic daily share prices are analysed to arrive at annual and cumulative historic volatility estimates (which may be adjusted for any abnormal
periods or non-recurring significant events). Trends in the data are analysed to estimate volatility movements in the future for use in the numeric pricing model. The simulated version
of the Black-Scholes model takes into account both the probability of achieving market performance conditions and the potential for early exercise of vested rights.
While market performance conditions are incorporated into the grant date fair values, non-market conditions are not taken into account when determining the fair value and expected
time to vesting of shares and rights. Instead, non-market conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of shares and rights included in the measurement of the expense
so that the amount recognised in the income statement reflects the number of shares or rights that actually vest.
Under the Group’s employee equity plans, employees of the Group are awarded shares and rights. An employee’s right to participate in a plan is often dependent on their performance or the
performance of the Group, and shares and rights awarded under the plans are often subject to service and/or performance conditions.
Generally, a right entitles its holder to be allocated one share when the right vests and is exercised. However, under certain bespoke plans, a right entitles its holder to be allocated a number
of shares equal to a predetermined value on vesting and exercise of the right.
The Board determines the maximum total value of shares or rights offered under each plan having regard to the rules of the relevant plan and, where required, the method used in calculating
the fair value per security. Under ASX Listing Rules, shares and rights may not be issued to the Company's directors under an employee equity plan without specific shareholder approval.
Under the terms of most offers, there is a period during which shares are held on trust for the employee they are allocated to and cannot be dealt with, or rights granted to an employee
cannot be exercised, by that employee. There may be forfeiture or lapse conditions which apply to shares or rights allocated to an employee (as described below), including as a result of
the employee ceasing employment with the Group during those periods or conduct standards not being met. Shares allocated to employees are eligible for any cash dividends paid by the
Company on those shares from the time those shares are allocated to the trustee on their behalf. Rights granted to employees are not eligible for any cash dividends paid by the Company.
In some limited circumstances, there may be a cash dividend equivalent payment made in the event that rights vest.
The table below sets out details of the Group’s employee equity plans that are offered on a regular basis. As noted above, the Group also offers bespoke plans in certain circumstances,
including in connection with material transactions, as a retention mechanism and to encourage the achievement of certain specific business growth targets.

The table below shows the significant assumptions used as inputs into the grant date fair value calculation of rights granted during each of the last two years. In the following table, values
have been presented as weighted averages, but the specific values for each grant are used for the fair value calculation. The table also shows a ‘no hurdle’ value for rights that do not have
any market-based performance hurdles attached. The 'no hurdle' value is calculated as the grant date fair value of the rights, and in most instances is adjusted for expected dividends over
the vesting period.

Capital adequacy
As an ADI, the Company is subject to regulation by APRA under the authority of the Banking Act 1959 (Cth). APRA has set minimum
Prudential Capital Requirements (PCR) for ADIs consistent with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision capital adequacy
framework. PCR are expressed as a percentage of total RWA. APRA requirements are summarised below:
CET1 capital Tier 1 capital Total capital
CET1 capital ranks behind the claims CET1 capital plus AT1 capital. AT1 Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital. Tier 2

• provide for fully discretionary
capital distributions.
Reporting levels
Regulatory capital requirements are measured on a Level 1 and Level 2 basis. Level 1 comprises the Company and Extended
Licenced Entities approved by APRA. Level 2 comprises the Company and the entities it controls, excluding securitisation special
purpose vehicles (SPVs) to which assets have been transferred in accordance with the requirements for regulatory capital relief
in APS 120 Securitisation and funds management entities.
APRA minimum requirements
APRA’s revised capital framework has applied since 1 January 2023. Under this framework, APRA’s minimum PCR as a percentage of
the ADI’s total RWA are: 4.5% of RWA for CET1 capital, 6% for Tier 1 capital and 8% for Total capital.
An ADI must hold a capital conservation buffer above the PCR for CET1 capital. The capital conservation buffer is 3.75% of the ADI’s
total RWA. As a D-SIB in Australia, the Group is also required to hold an additional buffer of 1% in CET1 capital.
In addition, APRA requires the Group to hold a countercyclical capital buffer set on a jurisdictional basis, with a default setting of
1% for Australia.
APRA may determine higher PCRs for an ADI and may change an ADI’s PCRs at any time. A breach of the required ratios under APRA's
prudential standards may trigger legally enforceable directions by APRA, which can include a direction to raise additional capital.
Capital Management
The Group’s capital management strategy is focused on adequacy, efficiency and flexibility. The capital adequacy objective
seeks to ensure sufficient capital is held in excess of regulatory requirements, and within the Group’s balance sheet risk
appetite. This approach is consistent across the Group’s subsidiaries.
Capital ratios are monitored against operating targets that are set by the Board above minimum capital requirements set
by APRA.
The Group’s capital ratio operating targets are regularly reviewed in the context of the external economic and regulatory outlook
with the objective of maintaining balance sheet strength.
From 1 January 2023, the Group’s CET1 target range moved to 11.00-11.50% to align with the new calculation methodology under
APRA’s revised capital framework.

Acquisition of subsidiaries
Acquisition of Citigroup's Australian consumer business - 1 June 2022
On 1 June 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of the Citi consumer business, including its home lending portfolio,
unsecured lending business (personal loans and credit cards), retail deposits business and private wealth management
business. The acquisition qualified as a business combination as defined in AASB 3 Business Combinations.
The acquisition was undertaken to support NAB’s ambition to build a leading personal bank with a simpler, more
digital experience.
The net assets recognised in the 2022 financial year were recorded on a provisional basis using preliminary completion accounts
and a draft purchase price allocation. During the 2023 financial year the final completion payment was made and the purchase
price allocation was finalised.
The final fair values of the assets and liabilities are summarised in the table below:
Group
$m
Consideration
Total cash consideration for the acquisition 3,135
Assets and liabilities acquired
Loans and advances 12,832
Other assets 523
Total assets 13,355
Deposits and other borrowings 9,488
Other liabilities 732
Total liabilities 10,220
Net assets 3,135
Goodwill and other intangible assets 248
Goodwill 80
Intangible assets 168
The most significant adjustments to the provisional amounts disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report are in relation to a $19 million
increase in net deferred tax assets recognised and a $3 million decrease in intangible assets.
The final goodwill value of $80 million is supported by the scale and expertise in unsecured lending acquired, together with
anticipated synergies. Other intangible assets comprise customer relationships and core deposits.
The goodwill has been allocated to the Personal Banking CGU (refer to Note 22 Goodwill and other intangible assets).

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of National
Australia Bank Limited
Report on the audit of the Financial Report

We have audited the Financial Report of National Australia Bank Limited (the Company) and its
subsidiaries (collectively the Group), which comprises:
► The Group consolidated and Company Balance sheets as at 30 September 2023;
► The Group consolidated and Company income statements, statements of comprehensive income,
statements of cash flows and statements of changes in equity for the year then ended;
► Notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies; and
► The Directors’ declaration.
In our opinion, the accompanying Financial Report is in accordance with theCorporations Act 2001,
including:
a. Giving a true and fair view of the Company’s and the Group’s financial position as at 30 September
2023 and of their financial performance for the year ended on that date; and
b. Complying with Australian Accounting Standards and theCorporations Regulations 2001.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under
those standards are further described in theAuditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial
Report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor
independence requirements of theCorporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the
Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the
Financial Report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance
with the Code.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in
our audit of the Financial Report of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of
our audit of the Financial Report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not
provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit
addressed the matter is provided in that context. The key audit matters identified below, unless
otherwise stated, relate to both the Company and the Group.

Information other than the Financial Report and auditor’s report thereon
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
information included in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report, but does not include the Financial Report
and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the Financial Report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report
and our related assurance opinion.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Report, our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Financial
Report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the Financial Report that gives a
true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001
and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the
Financial Report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Report, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s and
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate
the Company or Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Report as a whole is
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of this Financial Report.
As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional
judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
► Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Report, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control.
A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited
Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation
► Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s or the Group’s internal control.
► Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.
► Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s or Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Financial Report or, if such
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions
may cause the Company or the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
► Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Financial Report, including the
disclosures, and whether the Financial Report represents the underlying transactions and events
in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
► Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Financial Report. We are
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we
identify during our audit.
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions
taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated to the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the Financial Report of the current year and are therefore the key audit
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
